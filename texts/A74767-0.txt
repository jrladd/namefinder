 D Eare Brethren and Sisters, as my compassions to some bleeding hearts among you, did put me upon this discourse, in our more private weekly meeting; so their unexpected importunitie, for Copies, have necessitated me to print it, so as it was, suddainly compiled, and ruggedly delivered, unpolished, and untrimmed for publike view of all abroad. But being willing you should have it, I would rather deny mine own honour, then you of any spirituall comfort I might hold forth to you, who am yours in the Lord by many strong obligations.
