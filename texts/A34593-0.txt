 Most gracious Prince: 
 B Esides my particular zeale, there is a naturall interest in this ensuing Discourse to your Highnesse, as being the hopefull heyre of this Kingdome of Great Britaine, and the true inheritour of your Noble Vncles vertues,
 
(Prince  Henry)  as of his fortunes. The eyes of all men are upon you, in full view of those sweet graces of Nature and ingenuous disposition to go dnesse which all admire. If you shall be pleased to adde these examples and precepts to those of your Royall Father, taking them hand in hand, they wil lead you in your tender yeares, in the faire continuance of Honour and Vertue; and then his Majesty your Royall Father may for many yeares (for which we hope and pray) be a living Mirrour unto you of Piety, VVisedome, and Iustice, and all other Regall Indowments fit for so great a Dignity, to which you are borne. 
 Glad I am that it was my chance to meet with this pa tof  Ireasure,  truly gathered by that worthy Knight, deceased  Ireasurer  to your Highness Vncle;
 
and great cause I have to rejoyce that by this (through your gratious acceptance) I have the opportunity, humbly to tender, with this, my prayers at your Highnesse feet, for your long and happy prosperity. 
 So prayes your Highnesse most humbly devoted,
J. B.
