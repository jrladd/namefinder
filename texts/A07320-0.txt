Knight of the most Noble order of the garter, Lord High Chamberlaine unto her most Soveraigne Majesty, QVEENE of  great Brittane,  &c. And one of the Lords of his Majesties most honourable privy Councell.  Edward May  wisheth all health and glory. 
 My LORD, 
 F OR this Treatise I seeke no patronage, for if the Relation and the Author cannot defend themselves, let them both suffer. A Swallow flies better then a Swanne, though his wing be lesse: And one little Diamond will buy 17. of  those stones that were drawne to  S. Paules Church  of 17. Tunnes: yet whether this Description of mine be good, or great, worthy or otherwise, it is not dedicated to your Honour as a matter presuming towards your worth, or presence, but as a publike obligation in the face of the world, of my future and more solid gratitude: You have honoured me before the Noble Peeres, and highest Councellors of the Kingdome: You have otherwise done me reall favours, what am I, or what is in me that you have not conquered? and not by these benefits to me only, but these many yeares my observations of your most Noble nature, your more then humane partes, your vast and incredible comprehension of all things, both essentiall and accidentall to your place and dignity. Your innumerable merits and that universall acclamation of all men whatsoever, have made me, more your humble servant then you know, and when after a short space God shall giue me to sit a little quiet, tending mine own affaires, your Lordship shall see, not by my writings but by my doings, that I am more your Lordships then any French or thrice devoted servant.
