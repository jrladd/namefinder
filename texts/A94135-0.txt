 
 
 TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, My very munificent Friend,  Sir  GEORGE GRYMES. 
 Noble Sir, 
 I N the following Papers (which are but a Translation of Eight Propositions, as they were canvased by two learned Romane Catholiques) you will meet with some Primitive Learning under the name of  Orthodox,  and that will delight you; you will meet with some Moderne Learning under the name of  Hetrodox,  and that will not displease you: In both you will find the
  businesse of Secular and Ecclesiastique Power at full discussed, which will be no great burthen for you to reade; and a great happinesse to my selfe, that the world may therein see J am neither Popishly affected, nor ingratefully infected, since these lines walke under your Protection, (no friend to Popery, a great friend to Piety) and are Dedicated to you as a Tythe of that Gratitude, which is necessarily due from, 
 Sir, 
 Your most humble Servant,  T. S. 
 London,  Nov. 19. 1646.
