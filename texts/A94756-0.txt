 T His that I now humbly offer to your  hands,  hath been long in my  thoughts;  but much more since in my  attendance  on his  Majesties Children,  I have (under the  incouragements  and particular  favours  of the  Right Honourable  my  Lord  the  Earl  of  Northumberland,  to whose care You have intrusted those  Royall pledges, ) read thorow the whole  Bible  in an  expository way.  I have high thoughts of the sacred authority of  Scripture,  I admire the  wisedom  of the  whole,  and the admirable  concent  of all the  parts  of it, and doe firmly believe that the  majesty  of it will  triumph  over the attempts of
 all  Anti-Scripturists  to the contrary, till the time of our  Lords  coming again. 'Tis the glory of  Christian States  to  maintain  and  advance  it, which was the meaning of those  learned men,  who have lately  enriched  the world with that  treasury  of the  King  of  France  his  Bible  in  10. Volumes,  where in one  Frontispiece  they have represented a  Table  of the  Portraicture  of  Cardinal Mazarine,  supported and mounted by  Angels,  as being a great  Patron  of that  renowned labour.  May your  Names  also be great unto  posterity,  whilst you  promote  the  glory  of  God,  and the  saving knowledge  of  men,  by works of this nature. The learned  Licenser  intimates the  difficulty  of this, I also acknowledge it, but withall I nothing doubt, but under such an influence as yours it may grow to a full  maturity. 
 Your Honours most humble and most devoted servant  SAM. TORSHEL.
