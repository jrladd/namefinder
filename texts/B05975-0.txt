 
 To the truly noble Gentleman, Mr.  Heury Percy, Master of the Horse to the Prince his Highnesse,  &c. 
 Honoured Sir: 
 I T is in me a boldnesse, I must confesse, that deserves not to be pardoned, on so small interest to present a Toy, a light and undigested Pamphlet to you that are so far above it: And yet mee thinks this boldnesse is much more answerable, when I consider that you were once pleased (during that time, in which you were both an Ornament and an Honour to the Uniuersitie) to make use of my meane skill, and humblest service in this kind: and likewise that there is none more able, either to protect or judge of what I have written. From the first I draw encouragement proper to my selfe; in the other I make that encouragement mine, which is, or ought to be common to all that would
 make a fit choyce of patronage. And on these grounds I have presumed, among those many happier and more worthy labors which wait on your Name, to place this little one: which (although as it can never hope, so it can never have the happinesse to enjoy that measure of your Sun-shine, and so bounteous an eye as those more deserving) shall neverthelesse rest content in the conscience of that everlasting service which the Father of it owes. Be pleased then (most worthy Sir) to suffer your Name in the Front of this, otherwise poore and defencelesse Book. So that by that meanes it becomming acceptable to the world, I may not doubt but afterwards it will prove as profitable. My last, but not my least hopes are, that as you loved this Art in your youth, and have honour'd it since, so you will still advance it, and continue your favours to him that is 
 Your most humble Servant,  WILL. STOKES.
