 Sir, 
 I unii 18. 1645.  I received from you a Thing called,  The Souldiers Catechisme, composed for the Parliaments Army, written by  R. Ram,  Minister of  Spalding  in  Lincolneshire; you desired me to answer it, because it had done some Disservice to the King, as is supposed, in misleading some simple soules. 
 I have read it and beleive the supposition; and for present answer returne you the same Title, with this alteration onely,  Composed for the Kings Army;  certainely perswading my selfe that this truth (and it is nothing else but truthy may reduce those whom his Falsehood
 hath seduced; yet promising you, if so you will have it, speedily to answer his  verbatim,  and largely, which is here done onely in sense and breifely; yet fully I imagine for the service abovesaid, namely, To reclaime my Countrymen to their ancient obedience, which is your and all good mens desire, and amongst them, 
 Sir, 
 of Your Freind and Servant,  T. SVVADLIN. 
 Junii 19. 1645.
