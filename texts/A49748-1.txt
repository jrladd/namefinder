 
 TO HIS Most Sacred Majestie, CHARLES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, King of great Brittaine, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. 
 I  Could not answer mine owne Conscience (most Gracious Soveraigne) should I dedicate these Compositions to any but Your Majestie; they were born and nourish'd in Your Majesties service, and long since design'd (such as they are) an Offering to Your Royall hand. Many of them were compos'd by my Brother ( William Lawes, ) whose life and endeavours were devoted
 
  Your service; whereof, I (who knew his heart) am a surviving witnesse, and therein he persisted to that last minute, when he fell a willing Sacrifice for Your Majestie: I were unworthy such a Bro er, should I tender ought that is his, or mine, to any but our Graci us Master (from whose Royall Bounty both of us receiv'd all we  oy'd;) and such an Inscription would not only seem a Theft and  ienation of what is Your Majesties, but (which I most abhorre) would make me taste of these ungratefull dayes. Your Majestie  owes when the Regall Prophet first penn'd these Psalmes, he gave  em to the Musitians to be set to tunes; and they humbly brought  em to  David  the King. Besides, M r .  Sandys  inscribes his Translation   Your Sacred Majestie; so that this I offer is Your Majesties in all ca cities, and doth not so properly come, as rebound back to Your Ma tie. I was easily drawn to this presumption, by Your Majesties  own particular affection to  David 's Psalmes, both because the  alter is held by all Divines one of the most excellent parts of holy  ripture; as also in regard much of Your Majesties present condition,   lively described by King  David 's pen. The King of Heaven and Earth restore Your Majestie according to Your own righteous heart, which is the daily earnest prayer of 
 Your Majesties most humble, most loyally devoted Subject and Servant, HENRY LAWES.
