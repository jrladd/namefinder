 Essex,  Viscount of  Hereford,  &c.  And  To
the Right Honourable  HENRY  Earl of  Holland,  Knight of the
most noble Order of the Garter, and Chancellour of the Universitie of
CAMBRIDGE. 
 My Lords, 
 B Y the command of the one of your Lordships, I was summoned
to this performance; and under the command of the other, I prepared it at my
station in Cambridge; and now at the command of both, I publish it to the
world. Your Lordshipse having thus had a joynt influence into this poor,
 birth, pardon my boldnesse if I intitle it to you both: that
what worth it wanteth in it self, it may borow from the lustre of two such
names. God and Nature have united your Honours in consanguinity and
affection; which makes me presume the more to unite you here. Though to deal
ingenuously, in this case I rather crave your noble Testimonie, then
Patronage: It being best known unto your Lordships, that this Edition is
rather an act of my obedience, then choice. I know my self too well to think
that any thing of mine is worthy to be transmitted to an other age: And no
heart grieves more then mine, to see the boldnesse of the daring
Presse. Yet if any spark of pietie hath been kindled in any breast by my
meditations, I beseech the God of heaven to cherish it. To that Almighty
Goodnesse I betake your Honours, and rest 
 Your Lordships most humble and obedient servant
in the Lord, RICHARD LOVE.
