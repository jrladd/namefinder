 
 
 TO THE Right Honourable, and most worthy of all Honour,
 
 
 My Honoured Lord, 
 T O say nothing of your Vertues, nor my obligations, (which indeed the highest and best Language would rather derogate
 from, then any waies expresse.) In obedience to your commands, that as a Law must ever regulate my actions, I here present you from the Presse with what you have already seen in loose Papers; yet so as I have not presumed to passe it under your name; because denying it the subscription of my owne, and too unworthy of such a Dedication; though truly you could not blame me, had I offended in both, since I onely give the mettle, you the stamp that sends it abroad
 for good and currant; so as you owe me pardon and vindication if it shall reflect upon either, since I resigne both my own will and judgement to yours, and become rather passive then active in publishing these indigested thoughts, being in all things resolved to expresse my selfe 
 Your Lordships in all affection to be disposed of.
