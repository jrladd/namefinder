The Most Illustrious
CHARLES,
 PRINCE OF WALES, 
AND
 Heire Apparant  to the  Crowne  of
GREAT BRITAINE. 
 G Reat Britaines  present  Joy,  her future  Hope, 
 And  Faiths Defender  against  Romes  proud 
Pope; 
 Vouchsafe to cast Your  Gracious Princely eye 
 On these  unpolish't Poems;  which descry, 
 Refute some  foule, grosse Errors, Practises 
 Of  Romes false Church.  By one short view of these, 
 Your  Highnesse  may conjecture of the rest, 
 And be stirr'd up for ever to detest 
 With greatest  Zeale, Romes Errors, Blasphemies; 
 Which make  good hearts  with indignation rise 
 Against them.  Great Jehovah  Crowne and blesse 
 Your  Highnesse  with  all kindes of Happinesse; 
 And, through  Your Favour,  make this  PVRGE  of use, 
 Si ke Roman Soules  to  true Health  to reduce. 
 So prayeth,  Your  Highnesses 
most humble devoted  Servant, 
WILLIAM PRYNNE.
