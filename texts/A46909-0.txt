 
 
 To the Right Worshipfull, and his much honoured friend  John Savile  of Methley Esquire, and High-Sheriffe of the Countie of  York. 
 SIR, 
 ONe being friendly chidden, that he did not write Books, made this answer,  ut libet non licet, ut licet non libet; As he would he could not, and as he could he would not.  I confesse I have been often expostulated withall by some particular friends & relations, (who usually over rate whom they love,)  hy in this scribbling age, wherein the Pen is so Rheumatick, I have never appeared in Print   but my answer is made before;
 
I attest the searcher of hearts, never thought any light that shone from my darknesse, wor¦thy to bee set on so publique a Stage, especially in this censorious age, which like  August  Caesar,  Taxeth all the World wherein (by reason of the con¦trarietie of mens judgements and affections) Sermons are made b  the Whetstones for men to sharpen their tongues upon. 
 The causes which move me a  this time to be more publique besides the importunitie   friends, (the ordinary Midwif  of the Presse) are these, first that I might once in my life be¦stow a small Token on the Spou  of Christ; and secondly, that might in a slender gift, give a te¦stimony of a not slender affecti¦on towards you, not having
 
wherewithall further to honour you. The State hath put the white Rod in your right hand, let me take the boldnesse to put a Role in your left. 
 It was the custome of the subjects of  Artaxerxes  King of the Persians, to present him something in his travell; a poor labouring man having nothing else, brought him a little water from the River that ran by, and presented it with both his hands; which the King did with a cheerfull countenance accept, esteeming it as honourable to receive small things, from a large heart, as to impart great. If my abililitie were as large as my heart, I would do more to honour you; bee pleased therefore to accept what I can, since I cannot doe what I would. 
 These poor thoughts of mine must needs redound upon your selfe, for every thing must acknowledge its first Spring and rise; they were yours in service to your desire, be pleased to let them be yours in acceptance and Patronage. The God of truth and peace give you to be famous in  Ephrata,  and do worthily in  Bethlehem,  that you may lay out all your power and affections in a flaming zeal of the glory of Gods truth and the Kingdoms peace, which is the constant prayer of him, who is, 
 Your Worships affectionate servant,
John Johnson.
