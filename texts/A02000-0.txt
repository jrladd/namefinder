 
 
 To the high, Noble, and
most Illustrious:
CHARLES,
Prince of Wales, &c. 
 S Ir, let the strength
of my desires to serve
you, obtaine your pardon,
for this my triviall dedication.
Yet if the title of this
booke bee true, (which is not
mine, but the first authors) it
may prove worthy your inspection;
if not, your perusall. For,
the few rules therein conteyned,
(if he may be credited)
being well observed, will gaine
 
you the love of all men; and
(consequently) command
their obedience. Two things,
which Princes, above others,
have greatest neede of, and
wherein they become most happy,
being made thereby, more
absolute, then either by rigor
of Lawes, or force of Armes.
It is (I confesse) most true,
that the great deedes, and heroick
actions of Princes, are
of highest esteeme: yet are they
not (therefore) to bee altogether
regardlesse, even of their
ordinary behaviour, and usuall
cariage. For as by them, they
become most powerfull, and
renouned: so by these, (if
pleasing, and gracefull) they
 
grow more endeered, in the
peopls affections. This treatise
was first penned by a Courtyer.
Therefore if it bee not well
translated, no marvaile, for
how should a plodding Lawyer,
make a neate construction, of a
quaint and polite Gallants
meaning? rude as it is, I hope
your highnesse will be pleased
to accept of it, not casting
your eye so much upon the
course visage, of the present,
as upon the faire intentions
of the presenter. I confesse
there be no dainties in it, fit
for your curious palate, yet
(I beseech you) bee pleased
to tast of it, that others, for
whom such course fare is farre
 
more proper, may thereby
bee brought, to relish it
the better. All I will say
in its commendation, is this:
it is but briefe, and is full
of variety. 
 Inner Temple  the 28
of  March,  1640. 
 Sir, 
 I am
Your Highnesses in all
duty and observance
to be commanded,
William Style.
