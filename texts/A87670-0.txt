 
 
 TO THE KINGS MOST Excellent Majesty. 
 May it please your Majesty, 
 W Hen the King of Kings had fasted forty dayes and forty nights,
hee was afterward an hungered: (although assisted by the deitie) and
then for any within knowledge of it to neglect administring to him a
morsell had really concluded them guilty of the highest ingratitude and
inhumanity.  Man lives not by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of Godâ–ª  Which your long abstinence from,
in relation to publique administration; hath put mee upon this bold attempt,
in tender compassion to your better part; as to present you with a branch
the fruit whereof will, if savoured sensibly, procure an appetite, to
those delicates, which by more excellent hands are ready at your call to be
served in unto you: which degree of recovery will disrobe thousands of
Gods people, and your faithfull Subjects of their sad and sable thoughts,
and serve up their hearts to the highest degree of prayse that hath, in
relation to his glory, and your good, so far heard their prayers. 
 Thus, thus  Sir,  if your Majesty please to forsake
your nets that intangle you; deny your selfe, and your self-reasoning
audience that assault You, and follow Jesus Christ in his
ordinances the Prince of peace, whose name is  Councellor  to
advise you. You may yet create all good men your cordiall friends; and admit
none to repine at your returne, but the Gospells and Religions enimies. 
 Great  Sir,  If this plainnesse bee an error it is my
affection to your Majesties soule makes mee to erre, and the prosperity
of one fault, hath made mee confident to commit a second; for I professe
I long after it, and make it one part of my designe, at the throne of grace,
that God would so sanctifie all your experiences for the time past; that
you may be a gratious Instrument for the advancing of his glorious will for
the time to come: And now the Lord grant you usefull profit, in perusing
my poore indeavours so as shall best sort both for the
accomplishment of your owne eternall good, and the Kingdomes
just desires, yea the Lord grant that as this sermon received grace from
you in hearing it with reverent attention; so it may increase grace in you
by your serious intention. And the Lord of peace peaceably salute you by
it: and grace you with all spirituall blessings till he bring you to injoy
his, and your peoples firme love; your Parliaments councell; and Heavens Glory:
which is and shall be the daily prayer of 
 Gods Majesties poore Embassador to You in this
Treatise of Peace, and Your Loyall Subject SAMUEL KEM.
