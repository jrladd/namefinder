 
 
 To the High and Honourable
Court of
 Parliament. 
 W Hat others have
done by the
 Law  of your  authority,
Presented 
before yee
their  advise  in  matters  of  Religion; 
I shall, from the  law 
of  love  to your  Iust authority, 
present ye, not  my advise  (the
Lord himself advise and
counsell ye) but some  things 
which concern the Lord  Iesus
Christ,  and the  peace  and
 prosperity  of your  Kingdome; 
 
and that I may not be  disobedient 
to the  heavenly vision, 
 . Act. 26. 19   or  light  of  God  revealed
 in me. 
 There are two  Principles 
in the world which have
these sad, and  dark  conclusions
 attending  them, the
two Principles are these: 
 1. That such as conforme
not to the  Doctrine,  and  discipline
established;  and yet as
to the  State  are  good Subjects, 
and  peaceably  affected, shall
be  proceeded  against by  fines,
imprisonment,  &c. 
 2. That such as shall
 speak  upon the  Scriptures,  or
open them,  Publikely,  or in
 Private,  and are not  ordained 
by the laying on of the
 hands  of that present established
 ministery  of a  kingdome, 
shall be proceeded against
 
by  fines, imprisonments, 
&c. 
 The  sad  and  dark  conclusions
which follow, are these: 
 1. All the glorious  discoveries 
of  God, above,  or  beyond 
that  Systeme,  or  form  of
 Doctrine  &c. shall be  judged, 
and  sentenced,  as  Heresie  and
 Schisme;  and so  God  himself
shall be  judged  by  man, 
which must needs be a  sin, 
bringing much  desolation; 
unless they that enact such
Laws, were that very  infallible
Apostleship  for  Interpretation 
of all  Scriptures;  as the
first  Apostleship  was for  writing 
all  Scriptures.  And is
 God,  a  God  of the  Iewes  only,
is he not a  God  of the  Gentiles 
also? Rom. 3. 29.  ? Psal. 51.   that is, is  God  limited
to one  sort  of  men? 
Thou  thoughtest  (saith God)
 
that  I was altogether, Psal. 51.   such  a
one  as thy  self;  that is, a  God 
meerly of one  Image  or  figure: 
behold, the  Heaven  of
 Heavens  cannot contain him, Psal.  
he dwelleth not in  Temples 
made  with hands,  and where
is  his habitation,  and who
hath  known the place  of his
 rest?  That is, what is  man 
that he should conceive that
 God  is only in a  place,  or  Temple, 
or  form  of  Worship,  or
 Systeme  of  Doctrine  of his
 forme  or  making,  since the
 time  is come, that we do no
longer  worship  in this  Temple, Joh. 4.  
nor at  Ierusalem;  but they
that  worship,  must  worship  in
 spirit  and  truth; Joh. 14.   which  truth, 
is he only who is the  truth. 
 2. Many thousands of
 pretious Christians  shall be
under  Delinquency,  as to  fines,
 
imprisonment,  &c. and under
the scandall of  Hereticks  and
 Schismaticks;  because not
seeing by that  one  light, nor
believing in that one  Proportion 
of  faith,  nor receiving
such  interpretations  and
 Consequences  of  Scriptures,  for
the very  Scriptures  themselves;
and by such  persecution, 
the  civill power  which
is received from  God,  shall
be turned against  God,  or against
the more  spirituall administration 
of  God;  and so
 Gods Administrations  dashed
 one  against  another. 
 Act. 9.  Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?  touch not  Psal.  mine anointed,
 and do my Prophets
no harm:  not as  having dominion
over the heritage,  or Lordship over faith. 
 3. That were to set up
 
the  Church Politie  of the  Iews 
amongst  Christians;  and not
according to  Gods divine apointment, 
but  mans;  for  God 
in that first Politie of the
 Iews Church  under the  Old-Testament, 
joyned to the
 Kings  and  Magistracy  then,
a  Priesthood  with  Vrim  and
 Thummim;  and  Prophets anointed 
of  God  as a  certain,
true, infallible, directive  power
for ordering that way of
 administration;  but this way
of  Christians  now,  without 
any such  warrant,  or  appointment 
of  God  brings back again
the same  Church Politie, 
under the  New-Testament, 
which was typicall
as to  Christ  the  King,  and
 Priest,  and  Prophet,  and joyns
to  Kings  &  Magistracy  now,
a  ministery less  of  God,  less
 
certain, less true, not  infallible; 
so as all  texts, instances, 
and examples brought
from the  Old-Testament  of
the  Kings, Princes,  and  Magistrates 
of  Israel, compelling 
to the  worship  of  God,  without
proving the continuance
of the same  Church Politie 
under the  New-Testament; 
and the like  Priesthood,  and
 Prophets  accordingly  sent  of
 God  to direct them, is all  invalid, 
and of no effect as to
such  proceedings. 
 4. The  infinitely  abounding
 spirit  of God, which
blows  when  and  where  it  listeth, 
and  ministers  in  Christians 
according to the  gift,  and
 prophesies  according to the
 will  of the  Almighty God; 
pouring its self out upon all
 flesh,  giving out the  word  and
 
making the  company  great, Joh. 3. 8. Rom. 12. 6. Act. 2. 18. Psal. 68. 11.  .  
 who publish  it, even this  Almighty, 
 all  glorious, infinitely
abounding, dispensing,  and  revealing 
Spirit, is made subject
to the  Laws  &  Ordinances 
of  men,  to the  pleasures  and
 wills,  to the measures and
forms of men, to  outward  ceremonies,
as Ordination,  &c. 
God must not speak till man
give him leave; not teach, nor
Preach, but whom man  allows, 
and  approves,  &  ordains. 
 5. This making  laws  for
punishing all that  conforme 
not to the  doctrine  and  discipline 
established, destroyes
the true interests of all  states 
and  kingdomes,  excluding all
 societies  of men, but of one
 sort  and  forme,  though never
so peaceably  affected,  or
 obedient as men  and  Subjects, 
 
respectively to the  State,  and
 civill government  thereof,
and was never found in any
 State,  or  Church Politie  by
 divine  appointment, but in
that one  nation  of the  Iews, 
whose  Politie,  as to such a
form, God himself peculiarly
made, owned and preserved,
and the  Lord Iesus 
himself  fulfilled  and dissolved. 
 For  Heresie  and  Schisme,  I
know ye ought not to tolerate
any, but to let them
bear their  own judgement, 
which is spirituall  admonition,
Church-censure, rejection,
excommunication;  which if
 effectuall,  as all  true, right,
spirituall  censures have been
and are, is that  just proportionable
judgment  for such
Gospel-sins, if not  effectuall; 
 
then the  insuffiency, Tit. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2 Thes. 3. 15.  .    weakness, 
 unprofitableness  of  such  as assume
such  Church-power,  and
 censures,  will appear before
ye. 
 And as to that  point  of the
present  Ordination,  which
some have  so pressed  upon ye,
distinguishing to ye, that
their  Ordination  was from
the  Bishops,  as  Ministers,  not
as  Bishops. Right Honourable, 
consider, that distinction
cannot be, for there was no
such thing as  Ministers  in
the  Church  of  Rome,  or of
 England  as to this successively
pretended  Ordination;  but
 Priests,  and  Bishops,  or  Episcopacy, 
and  Priesthood:  and
surely if  Episcopacy  doth not, See  Mason. Fox  booke of Martyrs.  Beda.   
yet  Priesthood  doth altogether
 evacuate  the  essence  of
 Ministery  now under the
 
 New-Testament  as by such
 Ordination:  and how much
more  rationall  are their Arguments,
who hold their
 Ministry lawfull,  from the
 lawfulness  of  Episcopacy; 
then those, who deny  Episcopacy, 
&c. and yet have no
 Ordination  but from them. 
 For this  Christian-liberty,  it
is such as preserves not only
the outward  peace  of  Christians 
who enjoy it, but the
 peace  and  prosperity  of  Kingdomes, 
and  Magistrates,  who
 establish  it; and the  life, glory, 
and  happiness, destruction, 
and  death  of  Kingdomes  is
wrapped in the  Christians
life  or  death: Ephes. 5. 30. Act. 9. 4. Mal. 3. Psal. 105. 15.   they are the
 parts  and  Members  of Christ,
the  apple  of  his eye,  his  Jewels, 
 his  anointed,  his  Prophets, 
his  Children. 
 
As therefore ye look to be
prospered by this  Spirit  of
 God;  as ye look for  wisdom 
from this  Spirit  of  God  to
govern this State; as ye look
for comfort from this  Spirit 
of  God  in all your  distresses; 
as ye look for  gifts  from
this  Spirit  of  God  in all the
 administrations;  as ye look
for the sweet  spirituall breathings 
and  refreshment  from
this  Spirit  of  God  in all the
severall  changes  of this  creation:
love, preserve, Indulge 
this  Spirit; quench  not,  oppose 
not,  oppress  not this Spirit:
confine it not to one outward
form or fellowship of
men, which are not that
Catholick Church, Thse 1. 5 19. Act. 7. 51. Ephes. 4. 30.   that  Apostleship 
of  infallibility;  and
they that are  spirituall,  live
in that  spirit  &  truth,  which
 
makes them  free indeed, Joh. 8. 32, 36.  .   and
it is below that  Spirit  of
 God,  to  Petition liberty  of
conscience in  spirituals,  from
any  men  or  Magistrates  in
the World; because God
 will make Ierusalem a cup of
trembling  to all  Nations,  and
a  stone  of  astonishment;  and
the spirituall  Christians  will
rather hold forth such
things, to bear witness to
the  truth,  and to desire all
to forbear  persecution,  as
much for  their own  sakes
who  persecute,  as for  theirs 
who are  persecuted. 
 And for that just  power  of
 Magistracy,  I acknowledge
it a  Power  Ordained of  God, . Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3.  
for  administration  of  Iustice 
and  righteousness  in the  societies 
of men, and  nations;  a
 Minister  of  God  for  good,  a
 
 terrour  to evill  works;  and
that we are to be  subjest to
every Ordinance of man,  for
the  Lords sake;  and for this
cause we  pay tribute to whom
tribute; honour to whom honour: 
and all  societies  of  Christians 
by no  pretence  of  religion,  or
liberty for the worship of
God, Rom. 13. 4, 5.  .   are to  resist  or  disturb 
the  civill administration  of
this  power:  but as to that
consideration; all  Christians 
are to  suffer  according to the
 will  of  God,  (all lawfull ways
for  preservation  of  States  and
 Kingdomes  still excepted)
and all such  Magistracy  are
to preserve their  respective
States,  by all  wholesome, lawfull, 
cautionary  Lawes  and
 Ordinances  in  Peace;  so as
while  liberty  or  indulgency, 
as to the  tender consciences  in
 
Religion is spoken on, yet no
less  security  of the  State,  no
 diminution  to the just power
of  Magistracy;  no less  preservation 
of the  Peace  of the
 Kingdom  is desired by those
that are truly  spirituall.  And
though many suffer under
the  name  of  Hereticks  and
 Schismaticks  before ye, for
not conforming to the present
 doctrine  and  discipline
established; Right Honourable, 
consider, whether this doth
not call in question all the
very present  doctrine  and
 discipline  so established; for
by this very thing of judging
all  Inconformity  to the
present  worship  and  form  of
 things  to be  Heresie;  by the
same, all this present  form  of
 worship  and  confession  of  faith 
is judged  Heresie  and  Schism, 
 
to the late  former  government,
and  doctrine  established
in the Church of England:
this present  Synod  of
 men  being no more that visible
 Catholike Church,  and  infallible
Apostleship,  then the
former were, so as the
changing the former  Articles 
of the  Church  of  England  into
a new  confession  of  faith, 
the  Episcopacy  into  Presbytery; 
and so altering both
the  fundamentals  in  religion 
and the  discipline,  is equally
 new light  and  Heresie, 
As to the former  doctrine 
and  discipline:  (and if it be
objected) but this present
 Synod,  are men of more  light 
and  Piety  then the  former, 
and so they establish more
 truth,  and bring in more  Reformation; 
if so, why is there
 
not more  love,  more  peaceableness, 
more  self-deniall, 
more  power  of  godliness,  then
there was in the suffering
 Bishops,  and the Preaching
 Lay-Martyrs  then; who
loved  Christ  in  himself,  and
in one another. 
 And now (Noble Senators)
since  very worthy things
have been formerly done by ye 
unto this  Nation;  let not your
 Sun  set in a  cloud,  nor your
 light  shine upon those that
have  loved  you as the  Moon 
once upon the  Water,  making
it of the  colour of Blood▪ 
are  ye not  come to the  Kingdome 
in  Peace?  Are not the
 gleanings  of  Ephraim  in the
 Vintage?  Did not  David 
say, 2 Sam. 19. 22.    shall any man be put
to death this day in Israel? 
 The Lord enlighten ye (if
 
it be his will) more and
more, in the  knowledge  of
 Iesus Christ,  and of the  love 
of  God,  and of  all  who have
any  thing  of  God  in  them, 
and let you see those things
 which concerne your peace in 
this your day. 
 Your Honours humble
Servant,
 John Saltmarsh.
