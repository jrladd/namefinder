 SIR, 
 I  Thought my endeavours too poorly imployed, while they were restrain'd to the limits of a particular acknowledgement; w ch  forced me to comply with my ambitious humour, by making this publick profession of my duty & observance. I may seem both Ignorant and Indiscreet to
 
promise any new thing in this fardell of Epistles to you, vvho are able to give lessons of Courtship and Civility to the most refined Spirits of this age, yet I deserve pardon, if you consider that nothing is here but vvhat might either have bin written by you, or to you, and consequently deserves the approbation of the most malitious. For in the one your own Humanity, and in the other the Judgement of all the world is interessed: as is in all things that concerne your Particular, the repose, 
 SIR, 
 of  Your most humble and most obedient servant  J. M.
