 
 To the Right Reverend Father in God,  Thomas  by Divine providence Lord Bishop of  Bristoll. 
 Right Reverend Father, 
 T His Sermon is of right your due, for it was your order that first prepared it for the Pulpit; and it is your request (as you were pleas'd to make it,) that hath now commanded it to the Presse. My humble desire therefore is, that it may passe abroad under your protection, being confident that (as unworthy as it is) it will speed the better for your approbation. The world dares give credit to your Lordships Testimony, whose onely practice is enough to confute the many and malicious slanders that have of late been cast upon your holy function, by those that have been the Enemies of our
 Peace. God in mercy send us Bishops and Pastors after his own heart, and not after theirs; and increase the number of such Ministers, as are required by our Saviour in my present Text; that so by well doing, we may put to silence the Ignorance of foolish men. And the great Shepheard of soules continue your Lordship long among us, for a Pattern, both of preaching, and piety unto us, that are under you in the Lord; And, if it be his blessed will, vouchsafe unto us once more the blessing of Peace, that so we may the better see, what an happinesse we have in injoying you. This (I dare say) is the hearty desire of all your Clergy, I am sure it is his, that is 
 Your Lordships to be Commanded in the Lord. Ri: STANDFAST.
