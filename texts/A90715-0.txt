 
 To the READER. 
 B Eloved, It may seem strange (to many) that I am intermedling
with Controversies amongst the Learned
in Divinity. And therefore it▪ is likely that some will
say of me, as it was somtime said of one,  Thou art but
a stripling, but they are men of War from their youth▪ and therefore
not to be encountred with by thee.  And they will think it
more safer for me to be employed about meaner matters, of a lower
Nature, rather than to encounter with gyants. And (perhaps)
give me a nipping check, like that of  Eliab  to  David;  viz.  Where
are those few sheep left in the Wilderness? It is thy pride that moved
thee to come and see the battel.  But my answer is as that which
then was made,  What have I now done? Is there not a cause?  &c. 
 There were Israelites on the one side that stood for the glory of
God▪ and the lawful liberty of his children; and there were Philistines
on the other side, that did defie Christ and his redeemed Ones,
and they had one great  Goliah  on whom they did cast their confidence,
and he did approach towards the Israelites with reproach and
defiance, and yet those Israelites remained in a kind of astonishment. 
 Our condition is somwhat like theirs (if well examined.) And
although I am not furnished with such complete Armour as some other
(spiritual) Warriours are, yet if the stone of Israel be with me,
I shall have good success; You know, a jaw-bone was but a strange
peice of Armour, yet a thousand Philistins could not stand against
it, for God was with it: And his riddle did occasion the quarrel between
them; for they brake the Covenant of Garments and Sheets,
as some have done in a Covenant with me here. 
 I will not compare my self with any of those Warriours: yet
give me leave to put forth a Riddle; 
 By weakness comes strength▪
Yet strength beareth down weakness. 
 Canterbury,   May, 1648. 
Yours, for Truth,
 GEORGE PALMER.
