 
 TO THE HONORABLE COMMITTEE OF THE HOVSE OF Commons Assembled in Parliament, Concerning plundred Ministers. 
 Worthy Sirs, 
 F Inding that the  Honorable House of Commons  assembled in Parliament hath referred to your consideration, and examination, some matters touching the  Reformation  of the  Cathedrall in Canterbury:  out of my zeale to that worke, I have presumed to hold the Candle to you  (Physitians of value)  a little to further your discovery of that  Cathedralls  corrupt constitution, that you may more perfectly cure the  malignant disease,  called the  Cathedrall evill.  The worke is begun, the numerous  Idols, (dunghill-gods,  as the Scripture calls them) which defile the worship of God there, are sweeping out apace. And Oh that you would further cleanse that  Augean stable,  by removing the  Idol Shepheards;  Let not the oyle of the fat revenues of that  Cathedrall Covent  any longer feed such darke Lampes, and Lanthornes, but let it supply
 
burning, and shining lights, to enlighten those many  miserable adjacent Parishes,  which have a long time sate in darkenesse, under that huge, dry, flintie Rocke, called a  Cathedrall.  I have the ensuing History (for the most part) from mine owne observation, and have beene punctuall in examining the truth of what I have by information. My ayme is to further the  downefall  of  Babylon,  and that  Sion,  which dwelleth with this  daughter  of  Babylon,  may deliver her selfe. So most humbly intreating your acceptance of this my obliged service, I remaine 
 Yours to be commanded, RICHARD CVLMER.
