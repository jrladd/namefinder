 
 
 For the Right Honourable,
LORDS the Peeres, and Gentlemen
of the Honourable House of
COMMONS. 
 T He Author, as to the first
part of his Animadversions
touching the late motions
of the State, in the
visible pursuance of Arbytrary
power, presents
them not as newes to a
Court of Parliament, the evidence whereof being
obvious to all the world, onely hee ranckes
them here in a new fyle, for satisfaction of the
incredulous Malignant, not capable to owane
his owne friends, neither will be sensible what
your indefatigable labours have beene, or take
notice of the pains you have taken, during these
 
foure yeares, for Preservation of the common
freedome and liberties of the Kingdome. 
 As to the second part, which is a narrative,
touching the Warre under the conduct of major
Generall  Laughorns,  it is offered to all of discerning
Iudgements, how mirakculously Gods speciall
providence hath evidently appeared as well
in that particular of the County of  Pembrook  as in
the Generall prosperity of the Kingdoms armes. 
 The conclusive part, is both humbly monotory
and petitionary, that, that poore dessolated
County, with the parts adiacent may be timely
taken into your compassionate consideration,
and such a speedy course taken therein as may
best suit with your present great and urgent affairs: The inveterate fewds and dissentions of this County, hath beene a great hindrance to the publike service, and if not timely composd, may be of a more dangerous consequence 
The distressed condition whereof (through
 Gerrards  cruelties) is truly laid open unto you; as
also the way of this Counties repaire (in some
competent measure) humbly presented in a few
Propositions, which may both rectifie the many
grievances and dissentions of this County, together,
with the disorder of the Souldier; without
other charging the State, or farther
troubling, your important Consultations,
otherwise, then in your timely designation of
some honest and able Gentlemen, (as your Commissioners,
 
to examine all grievances, especially
in the behalfe of such, as have suffered in the losse
of their whole estates in the publike service, and
are at present reduced to extreame want and penury,
the care whereof in all humblenesse is desired
and left to your pious providence, least the
constant party there should bee utterly disheartned,
and at such time, as there may be present use
of their farther service, since probable it is, that
the Irish Rebels (on their late victory) may
thrust over such Forces into that County and  Milford
-Haven,  as may turn the Skales of your Victories
here (if not timely prevented, by garding
those Coasts with a strong Fleete,) both the
Welch Nation, and English Malignants in the
generall (howsoever now mastered) retaining
still their wonted hearts, may in all likely-hood
on all occasions joyne with the strongest. 
 And thus in all humilitie hath the Author taken
the boldnesse to present unto your wisdoms
the whole scope of his poore indeavours, and
humbly craves farther leave to concludewith the
Oracles of two great Princes, wishing, that they
may profit such, as they most concerne. 
 The strength of a King is the preservation of
the State, King  James  his Speech in Parliament, 1609.  the foundation thereof, is the people,
 
and woe unto them, which devides the weale of a
King from that of the Kingdome. 
 How guilty the Delinquent and malignant
party have beene in the fomentation of the present
devisions, the appeale is made to their owne
Consciences, which have most unnaturally invaded
the people in their representative, and have
indeavoured to deprive both King and Kingdome
of their great Councell. 
 Aequius est me tot,  & talium amicorum consilium, 
 quam tot & tales, meam unius voluntatem sequi. 
 How averse His Majesties great heart hath
beene in following the vestigia of this famous
Emperor and how fatall to himselfe, let 3. ruined
Kingdomes be the Arbiters, and his owne conscience
the faithfull umpier. 
 Your most constant and faithfull
Servant,
Gil: Batt:
