 T He occasion of this solemn engaging our selvs in Covenant with our God, you well remember, & the framing of this
 Model (as you know) was at first for your stay in an holy stedfastnes in the way and life of Christ (to which you had in some measure already attained) and for my own recovery after a long and bitter declining, (God in mercy gave an answerable
 success.) Those expressions of the way of life I have oft received from you, as the fruits of your own blessed Experience gave me the more confidence often to powr out my soul to you (a singular mercy to be interested in a faithful friend) in this  I  gained
 both ease and refeshing to a troubled spirit (and some consolation in so sad a condition  I  am cast into) in sympathizing with me in these saving experimental passages which  I  once enjoyed, though now (in bitternesse) have nothing to stay my
 Spirit, but (it was once otherwise) I have now only one suit, to beseech you to accept this your own, as it was first composed for our particulars, and to improve these sweet and spiritual experiences of the love of Christ shed into your heart, & God shall communicate
 unto you by his spirit daily, in your close walking with him, to establish your spirit in assurance and immutable cleaving to him in all faithful stedfastnesse, according to this our Covenant. 
 This is the daily prayers of
 him who will be ever found 
 Your faithful Friend And Servant,  W. S.
