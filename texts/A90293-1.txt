 
 To the Christian Reader. 
 READER, 
 T Hou canst not be such a stranger in our  Izrael,  as that
it should be necessary for me, to acquaint thee, with
the first sowing and spreading of these Tares in the
Field of the  Church,  much lesse to declare,  what divisions 
and thoughts of heart, what  open bitter contentions, 
to the losse of  Ecclesiasticall peace,  have beene stirred up amongst
us about them: onely some few things relating to this my  particular
endeavour,  I would willingly premonish thee of. 
 First, Never were so many  prodigious errours  introduced into a
 Church,  with so high a hand, and  so little opposition,  as these into
ours, since the nation of Christians was known in the world, the chiefe
 cause  I take to be, that which  Aeneas Sylvius  gave, why more maintained
the  Pope  to be above the  Councel,  then the  Councel  above the
 Pope,  because Popes gave  Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, &c.  but
the Councels sued  in forma pauperis,  and therefore could scarse get
 an Advocate  to plead their cause: the fates of our  Church  having of
late devolved the government thereof into the hands of  men tainted
with this poyson, Arminianisme  became backed, with the powerfull
Arguments,  of praise and preferment,  and quickly prevailed, to beat
 poore naked truth into a corner:  It is high time then for all the lovers
of  the old way,  to oppose this innovation, prevailing by such unworthy
means, before our breach grow great like the Sea, and there
be none to heale it. 
 My intention in this weake indeavour, (which is but the undigested
issue of a few broken houres, too many causes in these furious malignant
dayes, continually interrupting the course of my studies) is
but to stirre up such, who having  more leasure,  and  greater abilities, 
will not as yet move a finger, to help vindicate oppressed Truth. 
 In the meane time I hope this  discovery  may not be  unusefull,  especially
to such who wanting either,  will or abilities,  to peruse larger
discourses, may yet be allured by their  words  which are smoother then
oyle, to tast the  poyson of Aspes  that is under their lips: Satan hath
 ,  depths  where to hide, and  methods  how to broach
 
his  lies:  and never did any of his  Emissaries  employ his received talents
with more  skill and diligence,  then our  Arminians:  labouring
earnestly in the first place to in still some errors that are most  plausible, 
intending chiefly an introduction of them that are more  palpable, 
knowing that if those be for a time suppressed, untill these be well digested,
they will follow of their owne accord: wherefore I have endeavoured,
to lay open to the view of all, some of their foundation errors,
not usually discussed, on which the whole inconsistent superstructure is
erected, whereby it will appeare, how under a most  ine pretence of
furthering Piety, they have prevaricated against the very  grounds of
Christianitie:  wherein 
 First, I have not observed the same method in handling each particular
Controversie, but followed such severall waies as seemed most
convenient to cleere the truth and discover their heresies: 
 Secondly some of their errors I have not touched at all, as those
concerning  universall grace, justification,  the  finall Apostacy of true
beleevers:  because they came not within the compasse of my proposed
method, as you may see  Chap.  1. where you have the summe of the
whole discourse. 
 Thirdly, I have given some instances, of their opposing the received
Doctrine of  the Church of England,  contained in divers of the
39. Articles: which would it did not yeeld us iust cause of further complaint,
against the iniquitie of those times whereinto we were lately
fallen: Had a  poor Puritan  offended against halfe so many  Canons,  as
they opposed  Articles,  he had forfeited his livelihood, if not endangered
his life: I would I could heare any other probable reason, why  divers
Prelates  were so zealous for the discipline, and so negligent of the Doctrine
of the Church: but because the one was reformed by the word
of God: the other remaining as we found it in the times of Popery. 
 Fourthly, I have not purposely undertaken to answer any of their
Arguments, referring that labour to a further designe: even a
clearing of our  Doctrine of reprobation,  and of the  administration
of Gods providence, towards the Reprobates and over all their
actions,  from those calumnious aspersions they cast upon it, but concerning
this, I feare the discouragements of these wofull dayes, will
leave me nothing but a desire: that so necessary a worke, may finde a
more able Pen: 
 IOHN OVVEN.
