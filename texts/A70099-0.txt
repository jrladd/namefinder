 
 
 To the Right Honorable,  Algernon  Earl of Northumberland, Lord  Percy, Lucy, Poynings, Fitzpain, Brian,  and  Latimer;  Lord high Admirall of ENGLAND, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of His Majesties most Honorable Privy-councell. 
 Right Honorable, 
 THe unworthy oppressed Author hath not long since groaned under the severe censure of the late high Commission for the insuing speculations, which now he adventures to present unto your Honour, hoping for a candid acceptance, and interpretation of his poor indeavours for the good of  Zion.  Had not the rising Sun of an auspicious Parliament dispelled those clouds of oppresion and tyranny, that menaced a drowning both to me and
 
them, they had been choked in their  embrio,  and never injoyed the happinesse they have now attained in your Honorable aspect. Pardon (most noble Lord) the inforced presumption of the distressed Author, which implores and hopes for your honorable Patronage, and humbly praying for the daily increase of your Honours health and eternall happinesse, remains 
 Your Honours most humble, most devoted Servant,  William Fenwick.
