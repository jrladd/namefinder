 
 
 TO THE MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTY OF HENRIETTE MARIE, QUEEN OF ENGLAND, &c. 
 MADAM, 
 To be a nursing  Mother  to the Church, is the dignity and duty of a QVEENE; to which attribute seeing you have a right, as well by your vertue as your honour, I am emboldned to prostrate my selfe, with this small  Treatise,  at your Royall feet. It hath pleased God out of his infinite, and by mee, never-to-be-forgotten
  mercy, to call me to the Communion of the  Catholique Church;  for which I have also been called to account, and that in your  Majesties  family; which hath moved me (with other considerations) as to publish this my defence, so to crave your  Majesties  Patronage both of it & me. Never did persecution against  Catholiques  in  England  rage as now it doth; where like  Herod,  who as soon as  Christ  was borne, sent forth men to destroy him; So they, as soon as one is made a  Catholique,  or known to be so, seek his destruction. And as  Herod  because he would be sure (as he thought) to destroy  Christ,  destroyed all the  Children  that were about his age; So doe they pursue the legall  Protestants,  as having a little resemblance with  Catholiques,  that so they may (as they hope) spunge out all the remains and memory of the  Catholique religion. 
 And as God sent our  Saviour  into the world, and subjected him to all humane infirmities (except sinne) like unto us, that he might be mercifull; So hath he humbled your  Majesty,  even to a lower descent of suffering (considering your exaltation, from whence it must take its measure) than any other, who like an invaluable  Diamond,  were made to be firmely set in the
  most precious esteem of mankind; but by the unrelenting malice of monsters have been brought to extreme degrees of calamity: whose excellence as it is endeared to us all by your sufferings; so our sufferings (your heart being the more intendred by the sense of your own) we hope, shall render  your Majesty  the more propitious to us; who suffer not only as good subjects to the  King,  but to God also in the  Catholique religion.  Your gracious soule hath more antidote in it, then all the world hath poyson; which will therefore in your affliction make you like the Sun, which shewes his greatest countenance in his lowest declension; and bring you out of it, like gold out of the fire, refined, not consumed; which when it doth, as the good theef did our  Saviour on the Crosse;  So we beseech you  Madam,  remember us when you come into your Kingdome. In the mean time, we will remember you in our praiers; That your fortune may surmount your greatnesse, and your vertue your fortune; That your greatnesse may be above envy, your goodnesse above detraction; That your illustrious example may darken the ages past, and lighten them to come; that you may live beloved and die lamented; lamented by earth, but joy'd by heaven; of which you shall be a part
  as well as a partaker, in giving the happinesse of your presence, and receive as a reward of all your fufferings a never fading Diadem of glory: So prayes, 
 MADAM, 
 Your Majesties  Most humble, most loyall, and most devoted servant,  THO. VANE.
