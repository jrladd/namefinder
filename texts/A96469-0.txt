 Right Reverend and thrice Honourable 
 A S tending to its proper place, this small peece begs your Lordships Patronage being delivered in your jurisdiction. Your  lustre  danteth in the attempt: The  sweetnesse  of your  disposition  gives encouragement. 
 The matter  doth deserve your protection, being  Iustice inviolated,  like  Virgo, placed in  the Zodiack betweene those two signes of  Leo  and  Libra,  those two supporters of  courage  and Equity:  The publication  hath taken wing, being borne up with other mens desires,  The Author  doth lie prostrate before you,  Let thy Servant be a Servant 1 Sam. 25. 41. 
 To wash the feet of the Servants of my Lord, MICHAEL WIGMORE.
