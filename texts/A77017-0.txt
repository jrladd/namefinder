 I F that (much honoured Sir) I should here prefix any long narration in commendation of your  Worth,  I should of some be suspected of flattery; of all it would seeme a thing superfluous, seeing  it  sufficiently commends  it  selfe? such is your  Worth,  that who so readeth you throughout, cannot but entertain honourable and pious thoughts of you: your deserts of  Gods Church,  your singular  zeale,  your unfained  faith,  your sincere  profession,  your especiall care to advance Gods  glory,  and to root out  Papistry,  your constant faithfulnesse to your King and  Parliament,  hath beene such, that this Kingdome generally, but the  County of Berks  especially (your native  soyle ) have and shall have great cause to blesse God for you; hoping yet better and greater things; and that their hopes may meet with fruition, they have joyntly with one  heart  and  tongue  chosen you, (being  worthy  double  honour) Knight  of the shiere; and which justly  speaks  observation, no negative  voice  heard; which clearly proclaimes to the world, your sensible  goodnesse 
 
and  deserts  for the time past; Their great and glorious hope, that the Lord will make  You  an instrumentall Blessing, not onely to the whole  Realme,  but especially to  them  ana  their County,  for the future. Now, that this expectation may come into their  hands,  you have the  tongues  and  hearts  of  all ; of  all,  except some few of  Nadabs  and  Abihu's  sect, such as offer often times strange  fire  upon Gods Altar; they indeed breath out  flames  endeavouring to  singe  and  search  you,  your  visible goodnesse, and apparent vertues:  oh,  what will not  Ignorance  and  Malice,  (especially if  infected  with our Kingdoms new  disease ) dare attempt? what speech of wisedome can be so discreetly uttered, but it may by  Ignorance  be depraved? what action of vertue can be so exactly performed, but it may through  Malice  be mis-construed? It is not more proper to God to bring  light  one of  darkenesse,  than it is naturall for the Devill and his turbulent Imps out of the  light  of truth to endeavour to draw  darkenesse  of errour, and out of the best speeches and actions to straine and force out somewhat, to maintaine and nourish their corrupt humours and bosome sinnes. And what marvell? sith even in  Paradise  amidst the sweetest flowers and herbs a  Serpent  could liveâ–ª and find there something to feed upon, turning the   of those soveraigne and medle shall  simples  into poyson; but  expelling  these, I hasten unto that whereof I am chiefly to speake. 
 I am,  honoured Sir,  as full of  hope  as  desire,  that your  countenance  will helpe into the  light,  this bashfull piece of my composure? your  Affection,  and more then common  kindnesse  unto  me  hath emboldened mee to beseech that you will  Patroni e  this first fruit of my endeavours; as I shall not here remember all the favours wherewith I have been  honoured,  so can I not forget to mention some, especially those  reflections  and  glissonings  (which in  due  respect to you)  shone  on me, from that great  starre  lately
 
 fallen  (the able and reverend  Doctor,  the faithfull and worthy  Prolocutor Master William Twisse ) as, his last  judicious  and  elaborate  Book, which he so  willingly  gave me with his own hand; his thinking me  Worthy  (though  unworthy ) to  succeed  him as  Pastor  of  Newbury,  signed with his own hand; his giving me the free use of his rich and learned  Library ; under the  Sunshine  of these  beams (darted  on me  (right Worshipfull ) for  your  sake) have I lately lived; so that, it may be expected somewhat of mine should be  coloured  with  them.  indeed the  Argument  being an  Assembly  act, might therefore claim a peculiar  interest  in a  Prolocutours  religious Protection; but the former causes have invited, nay inforced me, humbly to desire  yours : Whose protection should I rather beg then  his  that hath made me happy both in  affection  and  action?  such is your known  goodnesse,  as that it is not onely extended to me, but fastened on all those that  sincerely  feare God (which makes the  publick Good ) with affections (like the  beames  of the  Sun ) immutable, unchangeable; marke the  rayes  of the visible  Sunne,  how constant they are, being not moved at all by the  motion  of the  object,  but immoveably flowing from the  Body  of the  Sunne,  though blustering winds  tyrannize  in the ayre, and remove  it  a thousand times out of his place in an houre, yet the  Sunne beames  keepe their  object  which they  enlighten,  and stirre not at all; in like manner, your  affections  (honoured Sir) like thc  beames  of the  Sunne  remaine unmoveable where  they  are once fixed, though blustering winds have  tyrannized,  and tossed  You,  your  Person,  your  good-name,  your most  godly,  most  humble,  and  devout Lady,  your well-governed Family, your great  estate,  &c. yet  your  pious  heart  and religious  affections  have remained  unmoveable ; witnesse your  cheerfull  constancy to  your  Christ and  his  cause from the  first  to the  last ; this is that which (more especially) adds unto my
 
hopes; nay, its  that  that makes me confident, that these few labours will find a  gracious  acceptance being humbly presented to your  Indulgency  and  Gentlenesse.  I conclude, fearing  prolixity ; the  Lord  of  Heaven  blesse  you,  and grant as  you  have beene heretofore  faithfull, just,  and  wise ; so  you  may continue to the  glory  of  God,  the increasing of  his  Church, and the profit of his  People. 
 Your Worships most  humble  and  faithfull, and in  Christ  at command, SAMPSON BOND.
