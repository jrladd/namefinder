 
 
 TO MY HONOVRED FRIENDS,  SIR GEORGE GRAHAM,  AND HIS VERTUOUS LADY, THE LADY  ALICIA GRAHAM. 
 Sir, Madam, 
 T He Kings retyrement hath given me a resurrection, and I appeare fearlesse, maugre all the threats of his and his Loyall Subjects enemies, in the dedication of these lines to your
  Patronage; assuring my selfe they will meet with the same welcome and reception in your Armes, which at first Your eares gave them; and Your munificent selves have ever given, to 
 Sir, Madam, 
 Your devoted Servant,  Thomas Swadlin.
