 
 
 To the Students
Of the
Innes of Court. 
 G Eentlemen,
Matter is better
than words.
If you bee noble,
worthy, and ingenuous,
these many precipitations
I here discover, need no
other effect than honest pity:
but if these endowments
 
of the minde bee excluded,
either by the rashnesse
of Youth (an ill Tutour);
or by violent prodigality
and licentiousnesse,
(a worse Disciple); My
desire is, that my serious
lightnesse, may arrow-like
pierce your Consciences, to
an unfained repentance.
The more you are contristate,
the lesse will be your
sorrow; for to lament, is
here to rejoyce: and such
joy I wish may be accumulated
on you, and on all
 
those, that either love
goodnesse, or are estranged
from it. The reason why I
present this Booke in chiefe
to you (after the interessed
Dedication) is, because
being my selfe, of one of
your Societies, my observation
and experiment hath
made mee conjecture, that
these two should never bee
unwelcome,  Advice  and
 Delight.  The first whereof,
if my Booke doe not
instruct, yet mine owne
deviation (still knowne to
 
many) may, seeing there is
no stability in bubbling
pleasure, nor no true content
without a religious returne;
so you have both
precept and example. And
as for the latter, it is better
wisht than described.
Reade and judge. 
 The Honourer of your
vertues,
Richard Croshaw.
