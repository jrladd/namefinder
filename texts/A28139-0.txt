 
 To the Christian Reader. 
 CHristian Reader, 
 I beseech thee, as thou tenderest thy salvation, that thou wouldest throughly examine the following Disputation, in the fear of God, considering how much his glory is concerned therein; and at any hand forbear to condemn my opinion as erroneous, till thou art able to bring pertinent and solid Answers to all my Arguments; for thou must know, that though I have contested with sundry learned men, yet hath none hitherto produced a satisfactory Answer to so much as one Argument. 
 Farewel.
 J. B.
