 W Hat I studied for your private Chappell, and there delivered before some of you, on Tuesday the  19.  of Iune, last past, I have been importuned to make publick, as for a common good. If it be good, then  quò communius, eò melius,  the more publicke it becommeth, the more good it may doe. I wisht well in the study and delivery of it to as many as desire the prosperity of our royall foundation. In the publishing of it, I would gladly have it conceived that my zeale is the same for the publicke welfare▪ If that memorable act of your piety▪
 
which occasioned this Sermon, shall provoke some well minded ones to imitate your example elsewhere, or incite the able handed to promote such charitable undertakings for the comfort of so many sick and distressed soules daily by your care refreshed: it may redound much to Gods glory, your owne comforts, and the happinesse of those whom God shall move hereby to tread in your steps. If no such thing succeed, yet it shall be your honour to have lighted up the candle of so good an example for the times to come: as it is, and shall be, for you all, that God may long continue to our Hospitall, your pious care for the happy and orderly government thereof, the daily prayer of 
 Your Hospitaler, William Freake. 
 From my Study in your Hospitall  the  12  day of Feb.  1639.
