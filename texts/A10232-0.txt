 
 
 To The Right Worshipfull and his worthy friends, M r .  Thomas Milner,  Major; M r .  Thomas Grimell,  Alderman, M r .  Ioshuo Greene  Alderman, with all the Society of that ancient Incorporation of  Kings Lynne.  Grace and Peace,  &c. 
 Right VVorshipfull. 
 T Hat of  Artaxexres King  of  Persia,  was never too highly
 
set and prised, which said; that it was of no lesse kingly bounty and humanity, to accept of little things, then to give great: I have received great things from you, and now what have I to offer unto you, but even these poore Meditations? which if it shall please you to accept, you shall more enrich and fill my desire by this receaving, then by giving. For to an honest minde it is sweeter to be regarded, then rewarded, and
 
what greater reward can be given unto him that striveth to bee thankfull, then to finde himselfe accepted in that, in which he seeketh most to please? Accept them I pray you favourably, and censure them charitably: for my part I intend especially (though I be of all men most unworthy) to further Christs Kingdome, which if it may, I have my desire: howsoever I shall leave it to the blessing of God, and your worthy Patronage.
 
Now the God of all consolation, according to the riches of his mercy, blesse you and yours with all externall, internall, and eternall blessings of his spirit, that all your actions may bee prosperous, your troubles few, your comforts many, your life long, your death blessed, your elections sure, and yur salvations certaine.  Amen. 
 Yours in the Lord JESVS. Tho. Purchas.
