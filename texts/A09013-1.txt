 W HAT  Thucidides  affirmes, experience proves true,  , that hearing is not lyable to any account, but  , whatsoever a man speakes (but especially writes) it layes him open to others censure, unto which J have now exposed my selfe, and crave your  Lordships  protection. Your  Honour  must not expect any high straynes in this Sermon. 
 Haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat Res angusta domi. 
 As it is J desire your  Lordships  acceptance of it, as an expression of some part of that duty and service J owe your  Honor.  The God of mercie poure downe his mercies on your  Lordship,  your Honourable  Lady,  and hopefull children. Which shall alwaies be the praier of 
 Your Lordships in all duty, and service. WILLIAM PARKS.
