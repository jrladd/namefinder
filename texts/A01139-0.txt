 
 
 TO THE
NOBLE AND
much honoured
Company of
HIERVSALEM'S
ARTILLERY,
all increase of  skill,
Successe  and
 Valour. 
 A S the Saints
were not after
the flesh,
so  the weapons
of their warfare
are not carnall, but
mighty through God,
to bring downe all the
 
strong holds and mighty
imaginations of divels 
and men, plotted
cunningly against the
Israelites of God; yea,
all the forces of the
flesh and the world
must faint, and fly upon
the use of these
Armes. Of this compleate
glorious Armature,
Prayer is a speciall
part; yea, it is the
very evergetical manifestatiō
of the powof
all the rest. Jt putteth
on all the other
parts, it keepeth the
 
whole armature close
to a man, it sanctifieth
all the rest to their several
uses it guardeth
all the rest of the golden
furniture from
theeves and robbers,
it daunteth the Divell
and the Divels limbs,
it carrieth the armed
Souldier through out
all forces and furies,
as a victorious Conquerour.
And hence
is that saying of the
Ancients,  Supplications
and Teares are the
Armes of the Saints.  As
 
the power and excellency
of this spirituall
peece is unexpressible,
by tongues of men
or Angels; so am I the
least of all to be called,
of so high & heavenly
a faculty; but
since it hath pleased
him that hath mercy
on mee to teach mee
the use of it, (though
in much weaknesse,)
and to guide mee as a
weake pensill in his
draught of the truth
of it, to whom should
J then commend it
 
both for the Touch &
Tuition, but to the
Military Forces of the
new Hierusalem, who
are experimētally acquainted
with this
peece of proofe? To
you then my deare &
thrice noble Fellow-Souldiers,
the Trained
Band of heaven, the
Artillery men of the
most High, I dedicate
my selfe and this litle
Treatise; accompting
it my only happinesse
if I be but a doorkeeper
of the Company;
 
bear with the feeblenesse
of my hands
in the unsheathing of
this Sword: man you
it with a holy and undaunted
courage, and
it will maintain you.
Times call you all to
the breach, stand
close one to another;
hold fast what yee
have, and let no man
take your Crowne:
Lay about you with
this fiery shaking
blade upon all within
you & without you,
that oppose Christ &
 
his Kingdome: Walk
worthy of so high a
gift; make not this
good commodity to
be ill spoken of; part
not with your Armes
and you shall overcome.
If these my
poor pains may adde
any thing to your skil,
the greatest recōpence
I crave is to have a
share in your cūning 
 Your fellow-Souldier
and Servant in love
GEORGE FOXLE.
