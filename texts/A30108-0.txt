To be communicated unto them that can, and have acquaintance or alliance with any whom it may concerne. 
 A Mong the portentous and prodigious Titles of the King of Bisnaga (so called by the Portugalls, but by the learned Writers,
 
Narsinga) Hee stiles himselfe,  Master of those which know not how to speake.  And the  Grand Signiour,  or Emperour of the Turks, would take it for no disparagement, to be called  Great Master  of the  Deafe and Dumbe;  with whom  fifty  of your Tribe are alwayes in  Delitiis,  and he holds it a great part of his state and magnificence, that he hath such sacred persons as you dayly to converse with as his Companions: And although some who understand not the mystery of your condition, looke upon you as  misprisions  in nature; yet to me who have studied your perfections, and well observed the strange recompences Nature affords you, I behold nothing in you but what may be a just object of admiration! For even your  Privative Qualification  is such, that the extent of our apprehension when it is most excessive, is but able
 
to afford an expression thereof our minde being much put to it to take a nominall scantling of your Quality, and it argues an admirable power in our soule, that it is so notable an Engin, that it can raise a positive notion out of privative: For  Deafenesse  and  Dumbenesse  being  privations  and  Negatives,  wee can easier say what you cannot doe, then what you can: For, that is beyond our reach, positively to state your abilities, which may be ranked with  honour, praise,  and  glory,  which although they have so great an influence upon us; yet wee know not where to finde their subsistance, or a sufficient notion to define them by. 
 What though you cannot expresse your mindes in those verball contrivances of mans invention; yet you want not  speech,  who have your  whole Body,  for a  Tongue,  having a
 
language more naturall and signifi¦cant, which is common to you with us, to wit  gesture,  the generall and  universall language  of  Humane nature,  which when wee would have our  speech  to have life and efficacy wee joyne in commission with our wordes, and when wee would speak with more state and gravity, wee renounce wordes and use  Nods  and other naturall signes alone. 
 This language  you speak so purely, that I who was the first that made it my Darling study to interpret the naturall richnesse of our discoursing gestures, not onely to the distinguishing of all the Corporall and Nationall Dialects thereof, and regulating the naturall as Accessories and Adjuncts of Rhetoricall Elocution; but to the following of them downe to their spring-heads and originall, even to the finding out their  Radicall Derivations 
 
and  Muscular Etymologies  by that thorough progresse of observation, am fully satisfied that you want nothing to be perfectly understood, your mother tongue administring sufficient utterance upon all occasions: Insomuch as being sollicited on your behalfe by a worthy Friend of yours (who had observed you not onely to be affected but seemingly edified upon the sight of the Alphabets of my  Chirologia  or naturall language of the hand which hee had presented you with, to an endeavour of accommodating them more to your use; I was enforced ingeniously to confesse, I could not improve them to any considerable advantage for you; since you already can expresse your selves so truely by signes, from a habit you have gotten by using alwayes signes, as wee doe speech: Nature also recompencing your
 
want of speech, in the invention of signes to expresse your conceptions: Yet a while after having well observed by your multiplying signes and gestures, that you earnestly desired to unfold your lips to an  orall elocu¦tion;  seeming as if you accounted your  dumbenesse  to be your greatest  unhappinesse;  in tender pitty of your case, I began to cast about which way as a  Motist  to be serviceable unto you, by supplying a  medium  of greater Discipline, whereby you might arrive nearer unto the intimate essences, of things, by apprehension, whereof your intellect might gaine somewhat a more proper perfection: When coasting along the borders of  gesture,  and  voluntary motion,  I discovered a  com¦munity  among the  Senses,  and that there was in the continent of  Humanity,  a  Terra incognita  of  Ocular Audition;  a treasure reserved for these
 
times, which had escaped their privy search, who guided by the illumination of their owne endeavours had in  sudore vultus  ransackt the bosome of nature, wherein wisdome had hid it among other Arts and Sciences which have their foundation in Nature, and neither grow nor encrease but appeare when time and observation unlockt them unto us: Having well scanned this  Magnale naturae,  I found it to be one of the subtlest pieces of Recondit learning, and that it bordered upon other avenewes unto the braine, as  Orall  and  Dentall Audition,  of which wee have discovered sufficient ground to raise a new Art upon, directing how to convey intelligible and articulate sounds another way to the braine then by the eare or eye; shewing that a man may heare as well as speake with his mouth. Upon which and other unlooked
 
for discoveries, I began in Idea, to conceive the modell of a  new Academie,  which might be erected in favour of those who are in your condition, to wit originally deafe and dumb, for which Edifice and Gymnasium having provided all kinde of materialls requisite, I soone perceived by falling into discourse with some rationall men about such a designe, that the attempt seemed so  paradoxicall, prodigious  and Hyperbolicall; that it did rather  amuse  then  satisfie  their understandings, insomuch as they tooke the tearmes and expressions this Art justly usurpes for insufferable violations of their reason, which they professed they must renounce before they could have faith to credit such an undertaking: For the satisfaction therefore of such knowing men, who yet are incredulous, and too superstitiously devoted to the
 
received Phylosophy, I thought good to hint the  Phylosophicall verity  of this  Art,  which I doe with the greater assurance, having gained an unanswerable Demonstration from  matter  of  fact;  for other matters hinted they must expect credit upon the like successe: Neverthelesse heerein I shall not descend to exact particulars, intending onely to present the I chnography of this Art referring the inward contriving of accommodations, and the me¦thod of operation to our intended  Academy:  In the meane time for the enlarging of your  Charter,  and to bring you into a neerer incorporation of society and communion with us: I heere commend unto you the  Accommodations  this Art holds out, wishing you all in good time a happy  metamsychosis  or  transmigration  of your senses, that so at least by way of  Anagram  you may
 
enjoy them all: That learning first to write the  Images  of  words,  and to understand the conveyances of a  visible  and  permanent speech;  from that  Hand A. B. C.  you may proceed unto a Lip-Grammar, which may inable you to  heare with your eye and thence learn to speak with your tongue,  which benefits of Art when you have attained, and are become capable of perusing this  tractate,  whose argument is so new and strange, that there was never so much matter concerning you presented under one object of the eye, containing a narrative of your originall estate with the supplementall advantages thereof, the novelty and inventive straine of this booke may at once delight and profit you, which is the hopefull wish of 
 Your officious Friend and Historigrapher  PHILOCOPHVS.
