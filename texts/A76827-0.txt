 
 
 To the Right Honorable, and the most worthy to be for ever honoured, ISAAC PENNINGTON Lord Major of the honorable City of LONDON, and one of the Members of the House of COMMONS in Parliament assembled. 
 My LORD; 
 P Osterity will by experience finde the Religious care of your Country, which you have so zealously and wisely discharged; and I am confident that your Lordships Memory will never meete a grave in coming Ages: And when those that are now enemies to our wished Reformation, shall be made sensible of their errors, they'le be ready to free me from flattery: I have endeavoured to give an Answer to that Libellous Pamphlet, and it being but weakely performed, I present it to your Lordship, not for its worth, but as an expression of that service I owe your Lordship for being so faithfull and dutifull a son to your distressed mother  ENGLAND:  My Lord, I beg no boon, but your acceptance; and lest your Lordship should suspect an insinuating end in this bold attempt, I shall crave leave of your Lordship to go as I came, that is, to remain 
 Your Lordships faithfull, but unknown Servantâ–ª
