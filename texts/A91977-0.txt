 
 
 TO THE Right Honourable the Committee of Lords and Commons residing at the Leager before Newarke. 
 Right Honourable: 
 I  Will not excuse my selfe or these unpolished Notes by the shortnesse of warning, nor by the monethly Fast the same week, but only by your Honours command, which must be my best plea, both for the Preaching and Publishing of them. Such as they are, I am
 humbly bold to referre both them and my selfe also to your censure, which I am confident will be favourable enough, because I have already tasted of a great deale of undeserved respect from you, which doth mightily ingage me to be 
 Your Honours most humble servant, 
Robert Ram.
