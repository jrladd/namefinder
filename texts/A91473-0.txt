 Deare and reverend Sir, 
 Y Our favourable acceptance of my present pains, and candid construction of engaging my self therein, is my humble request by my present addresse, whereof, though mine own insufficiency might beget my suspicion; yet the knowledge of your love (which thinketh no evill) gives me satisfaction; for although the piety and parts of my ingenious Antagonist did challenge an opponent of sutable endowments; and renders me presumptuous for my attempt therein, (unworthy to be named in competition with him) yet the perfect knowledge of your pressing pains of severall kindes in the work of the Lord, stopping the mouth, which otherwaies would have begg'd your own labours in this present businesse, together with the requests of some of our friends, prest mee hereunto, wherin, if I have not prejudiced the Cause I plead for; distasted you, nor dishonoured God, but (though in the least measure) have further'd the truth, it is the highest ambition, and greatest reward of 
 The unworthiest to be numbred amongst your flock,  J. P.
