 
 
 TO THE TRULY HONOUrable, Sir  William Playters  Knight, and Baronet, &c. 
 SIR, 
 T He Interpretation of Dreames is of the same Originall and Extent, as is the inspiration or Divine Vertue by which they are infused. That God appeared in Dreams and in the Visions of the night, the sacred Text doth plentifully testifieâ–ª And that GOD unto some selected
 
men, by a peculiar spirit, did give the perfect knowledge of the Interpretation of Dreams; the same Divine Truth doth give remarkable demonstrations. I need not to declare unto you the admirable guifts of  Joseph,  almost in the first Age of the world; and of the Prophet  Daniel  in the second. Their Interpretations in those dayes of the Dreames of the  Egyptian  and  Assyrian  Monnrchy, do sufficiently declare the  praescience  of their spirits, and how near of kinne they were to God, Our Author being a Philosopher, and working onely by second causes, by the light of Nature; had not that happy interest to be so immediately, so divinely inspired. 
 SIR;  I make bold to present him to you in an English dresse: And although by the Ignorance of Antiquity he had the misfortune to be a  Heathen,  you shall finde him through the Excellence of his merit, to be clothed in the most refined Languages of Christendome. I have the rather been induced to devote this Book unto you, because your Candor to the Arts, and excellent Experience in the great and choise affairs of Peace and Warre, is of a wide Latitude, and not to be confined within the English bounds. Your Experience beyond the Seas, doth sufficiently declare your worth, both when you travelled first by your self, and when being  Major Domo,  you afterwards took with
 
you (the lively image of your self) your most noble and hopefull Son; whose understanding in the knowledges both Polemicall and Politicall you increased by foraign observations, and admirably inlightned it by your own example. According to your noblenesse, in this tempest of Warre receive this Present of the Arts, and be pleased to protect revived  Artimedorus:  And also, (though the Subiect be of Dreams) to excuse his zeale, who will ever be awake to expresse himselfe to be 
 (SIR) 
 Your most humble and devoted Servant;
BERNARD ALSOP.
