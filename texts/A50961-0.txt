 
 
 TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR HENRY GARWAY KNIGHT, LORD MAJOR OF THE HONORABLE CITIE OF
LONDON. 
 RIGHT HONORABLE: 
 T His Sermon of right belongeth to you, being by your appointment Preacht; as therefore rivers
runne to the sea from whence they flow; so this returnes to your Honour from whence it
sprang. Besides, It is yours (my Lord) by a due debt for many favours received, for which,
having no other way to expresse my thankfulnesse, I commend this poore service of
 a verball but hearty acknowledgement for reall courtesies. Lastly, your wise
wielding of the Sword you have borne, having drawne the hearts and voyces of the best towards
you, hath also induced mee to this Dedication; wherein as others may see what you have been,
so your worthy Successour may see what he should be; It was once mine, it is now yours,
and so is 
 MY LORD,   Your Honours most obliged,
Mathias Milward.
