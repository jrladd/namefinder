 T HE ancient and moderne custome which all Authors have, and doe yet hold, in dedicating their workes to the hand of eminency and greatnesse, is grounded eitheir upon desire to see them powerfully protected, or by them to proclaim some testimony of devoted affection, or to appeare gratefull for benefits received, if I shall call to this support of my thrice humble dedication to
  your Highnesse, the aforesaid motives either severall or joyned together, I doubt not but their weight will begge pardon for my presumption, and incline your Grace to its favour, since whether I make my addresse in the humble supplication of the first, or in a revering sence of the second: or lastly, in the generall obligation of the third respect. I professe no more then what the least and meanest in the ranke of subjects is owing to the source of Majesty, whose influence quickeneth, gives motion and being to all civill industries, sending their lives to equall center. 
 In point of subject, since nothing from mine own conceptions was fit to adventure upon so high a theater. I assign my part to the onely choise and conveyance of an Authour, with language intelligible to the English shore, who in the variety and multitude of his writings, both Theologicall, morall, and historicall, hath as with a Cristall streame watered a continent of the greatest extent in  Europe:  and although in himselfe like good wine he needeth no bush to recommend him to the readers gust, yet in this presentment to your
  gratious Majesty. I will serve him in by the hand of a curious taster. Rare  Ca ssin,  who in a noble translation of the  Holy Court,  towards the end of the second part, hath these words, as well of proper gratitude to his person, as of a full Elogie of the graces and beauties of his minde. 
 I may well say (saith he) that I were stupid and ungratefull, if I shonld not confesse to have been much excited to prosecute this labour by the honourable invitations which my Lord Bishop of  Belley  hath used towards me in his works, I cannot set too high a price upon his recommendation in such a subject, for hee is verily one of the most able and flourishing wits that ever handled penne: to see the number of his Books, one might say, he began to write, so soone as to live, and to consider their worth, it is a wonder how so many graces and beauties which others attaine not but with much labour, increased in him, as in a soyle naturall for eloquence. 
 This Character flowing from so learned a pen, may of it self be a fair invitation to your Highnesse, to peruse the work which I have here drawne up to a translation: it is an extract
  of severall Histories culled out of two Treatises intituled  Singular Events,  and  Morall Relations,  an argument not improper for a vertuous minde, whether profit or pleasure be aymed at, for Histories are the store-houses, where vertues are faithfully conserved to posterities veneration, and vices detestation: it is an armory where armour of proofe for all degrees is fitted to the hand; it is a glasse wherein to behold, adorne, and fashion out the life to what is worthy imitation, and to have in hortour and avoydance what is deformed in the beginning, or foule in the end: in fine, they are the only monuments of truth, which they purely deliver, no way flattering or concealing any thing 
 Give leave then, most gracious Princesse, where I began, there to determine my thrice humble Dedication, with homage and binding oblation of these first fruits of my small industry to your all-atracting goodnesse, which let it deigne to assume unto favourable acceptance, herein imitating the precious amber, that commands the ascent of small, and worthlesse substances, not for their merits
  sake, but for the honour of its force, and vertue to attract. Thus my presumption I hope, may be excused, your Highnesse all commanding vertue being graciously inclined 
 To the humblest and lowest of all your Majesties most devoted servants, S. Du VER ER.
