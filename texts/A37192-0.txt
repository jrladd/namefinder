 
 
 TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE PHILIP Earle of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery,  &c. 
 My Noble Lord, 
 T He naturall affection, which by the successive vertue of your Family you have alwayes borne to  Poetry,  ingages me in the absence of the worthy Author, to present your Lordship this piece, that you, the best  Maecenas  of the age, might Patronize this best of  Playes.  Had M r .  Davenaut  himselfe beene present, hee would have elected no other Patron but your Lordship, and in his absence I beseech you accept this Worke of his; whose excellence, I hope, will excuse his boldnesse, who had no other ambition in the dedication, but that he might by publike profession be knowne to be that which has long time been in his private affection, 
 The humble honourer of your Name and Family. W. H.
