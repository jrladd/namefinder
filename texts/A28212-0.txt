 
 
 TO THE MOST ILLVSTRIOVS PRINCE, CHARLES PRINCE OF VVALES, DUKE OF CORNWALL, and Earle of CHESTER. 
 SIR, 
 I T hath pleas'd your Highnesse to command this Sermon to the Presse, and me to be your servant: what you have observ'd from either, that might incline you to so much grace & favour, I know not; unlesse it were my plaine dealing with the Times. This (indeed)
 
your Highnesse mentioned with a deep sence and relish. VVould God the mad world knew it. Certainly it were enough to stop the foul mouthes of some: enough to warme the honest hearts of others. God Almighty so compose the present troubles of this State, that the Government thereof may stand the surer for this shaking; and continue and increase his graces in you for the glorious support thereof, when it shal please him to lay it upon your shoulders. 
 Thus prayes  Your Highnesses most obliged humble servant, JOHN BERKENHEAD.
