 
 
 TO THE
RIGHT HONOVRABLE
the LORDS now Assembled in
PARLIAMENT at Westminster. 
 MY LORDS; 
 I  Have observed, that long Epistles
are as little pleasing as
long Sermons; and therefore
shall not be troublesome by a
tedious Dedication: Onely  your Lordships 
may please to take notice, that this
Sermon, which is now Printed in obedience
to your Order, before it goes forth to publike
view, comes first to be Presented to
 your Honours.  It is sufficient assurance
of acceptance and countenance, that  your
 
Lordships  pleasure is to have it published.
If now this  little sparke,  or rather  almost
dead coale;  shall give the least
light or heat to any heart, that shall vouchsafe
to reade it; and hereby any accession
may be made, to the praise, or to the fear
of  This glorious and fearfull Name, Deut. 28. 58. 
THE LORD OÆ²R GOD: It is
that which is desired, and as much as can
be expected by, 
 MY LORDS, 
Your Honours most unworthy
Servant in the work of the Ministery,
 JOHN WARD.
