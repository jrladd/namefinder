 
 
 To the Right Honourable LORD, PHILIP Earl of  Pembroke  and  Montgomery, &c.  One of those Noble PEERS who in these Revolting Times continue faithful to the Cause of GOD and the Common-wealth:  T. B.  wisheth increase of Grace in this Life, and Eternal Glory in the Life to come. 
 Right Honourable, 
 T He Author of this Discourse sent it over from  New-England,  without a Title, without a Dedication. The Title is supplyed: And now I make bold to supply the Dedication, by publishing the Book under your Honours Name and Patronage; which I suppose the Author himself would do, if he were here present, in regard of that neer dependence which his Reverend and Learned Father once had upon your Lordships Honourable  Father  of Renowned Memory,
 Mr.  Robert Parker  that famous Divine, whom the Prelates persecuted out of the Land, for opposing their Ceremonies, especially the Crosse in Baptism.  from whom he received his whole Livelyhood; besides many other great and extraordinary Favours which his Wife and Children talk of to this very day. I will not go about to commend the Work, which doth sufficiently commend it Self and the Workman too; of whose worth I could speak much, if I were not so neerly allied unto him as I am: Onely this I will say, (which all that are well acquainted with him know to be true) He is a man of singular parts, eminent in Learning, supereminent in Grace, strangely mortified to the World, wholly addicted to the Service God and the Church. So craving pardon for my great boldnesse in approaching so neer, being but a stranger, I humbly take my leave, and desire to approve my self 
 Your Honours truely devoted Servant in the Lord,
 Thomas Bayly.   Jan.  7. 1646.
