 MADAM, 
 F Or the  Honour,  and for a publike testimonie of your more then ordinary  Pregnancie  and  Capableness  in so young and tender yeares, I have now dedicated to your  Name,  what I prepared especially for your use, and for the service of your  growing
 vertues. Reade  over again, what you heard, and in part noted with your own  Pen.  Strive to answer your hopefull beginnings, that you may rise to be  the glory of Princesses.  This shall be a  Record  for after yeares, what you were at  nine yeares of age,  that hereafter it may  praise  your encrease, or  admonish  you, if it be otherwise. However it shall remain as a witnesse of the  faithfulnesse  of 
 Your Highness's most humble Servant.  SAM. TORSHE .
