 
 
 To the High and Mighty Prince CHARLES Prince of  Wales,  and Heire Apparent of the Kingdomes of  England Scotland  and  Ireland,  Increase of Grace, Honour, and Happinesse. 
 Great Sir, 
 I  Here present you with the sad portraiture of the  wasted and distressed Church and Kingdome of England,  which as it is both the  subject  and  partner  of your  Fathers
 sorrowes,  so it is now become the  object  and  matter for your Honourable Actions.  Many  great  and  glorious spirits  have lost their  splendour for want of worke,  and many others have failed of  true excellency by misemployment,  whilst the  greatnesse  of their  achievements  and  victories  have been  blemished  with  injustice  and  impiety,  and for want of a  right ground  of their enterprises, their  conquests
 over the rights of other men  have been but  splendida peccata, magna latrocinia.  God hath provided better worke for you to do;  Iustice  and  Honour  lye equally before you, and offer you a large  sphaere  for so  bright a Planet  to move in; Since your businesse is not to  oppresse,  but to  deliver  your  oppressed Father,  and his  people;  not to  invade other mens rights, but to recover your owne:  That you may be the  Inheritour  at
 once of the  valour  of your  Grandfather,  the  Great Henry of France;  and of the  Iustice  and  Piety  of your  Father,  the  Great Charles of England.  Of which two,  whether was more glorious, the former in the prowesse of his doings, or the latter in the constancy and patience of his sufferings, may be the great controversie of Ages to come.  Both these together are  a paire of golden Spurres  presented unto 
 your Highnesse  to set you forward unto  high undertakings;  that you may give the  Crowne  unto the  Stories  of your  Ancestours; let the foundation of your enterprises be Religion,  and then you may expect that the  great God will finish them with a golden roofe of successe, which is the hearty prayer of him 
 Who is a most humble and faithfull Subject of your Fathers, and honorour of your Highnesse. 
 Thomas Warmstry.
