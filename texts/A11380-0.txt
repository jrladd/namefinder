 
 
 TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD HENRY RICH of  Kensington,  Earle of  Holland,  Groome of the Stoole, and Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Chancellor of the Vniversity of Cambridge, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, one of his Majesties most Honourable Privie Councell. 
 MY LORD, 
 I T may seem a daring and superfluous act to present any draughts of  Policy  to so great a Statesman as your selfe, especially for me, so out of distance to yeares, experience, practice, employment, profession, but my privilege is the subject I make choice on, a subject enriched with all
 
these, I know, as the Samaritane said,  The Well is deepe, and I have nothing to draw with,  nothing if compared with the talents of deeper judgements, but my engagement to your Lordship is the Universiy, our Studies wearing your Honours title and superscription, and our Savoiur hath there entitled a Tribute, where there is  Image  and  Superscription,  what I doe heere is but in the right recognition, what I doe in the next leafe is in right of Dedication and patronage, God make your Grace a Jewell to the Crowne below, and prepare you a Crowne above,  My Lord, 
 Your humblest Servant, J. SAULTMARSHE.
