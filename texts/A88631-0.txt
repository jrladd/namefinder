 
 
 To the most Illustrious,  CHARLES,  PRINCE of WALES. 
 Sir, 
 H Ere is presented to your  HIGHNESSE,  in a very  small Body,  an  ample Volume  of  Loyalty.  Two incomparable
 patternes for Valour, Discipline and fidelity. Two who bestowed their choicest indeavours in the Service of His  Sacred Majesty:  and  Sacrificed  their lives to confirme their  constancy.  High were they ever in the esteeme of your most  Royall Father.  Which makes this your most  humble Servant  infinitely
 confident, that this  Memoriall  of two such  absolute spirits,  cannot chuse but receive a gratious acceptance from His  Son. 
 Jt is said of  Darius,  that cutting up a  Pomegranat,  he was asked by one, with whom (though with a well beseeming reservancy of State) he was usually familiar;  what thing
 he would wish in the whole world, that might vye in number with those graines or kernels in that  fruit?  O,  quoth he,  of Zopyrus's!  Now this  Zopyrus  was such a faithfull Loyall Subject, as he had suffered himself to be pittifully disfigured to improve his Commands, and make way for his Victories.
 May your  Graces Quiver  in the management of your most  Princely Affaires  be full of them; that  Sedition  may become a  stranger  to our Kingdom; that your  Crown,  in the future fruition of it, may  flourish:  and  ENGLAND,  now a spectacle of misery, become an  object  of  emulation  to all  forraine
 States  in the admiration of her glory. This is, and shall be ever the constant and incessant prayer of 
 Your most humble and Loyally-obliged Servant; PHILOCRATES.
