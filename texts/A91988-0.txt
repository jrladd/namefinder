 
 
 To the Right Honorable the Lord  Scudamore, Æ²iscount Sligo. 
 My Lord, 
 W Hen the orbe of learning is illustrat by the irradiation, and benigne aspect of Princes favours, then all things in a
 
Kingdome are conspicuous and beautifull; but when the great Luminaries and Patrons of knowledge are eclipsed, the orbe must needs bee obscured, and every thing within its circumference darkned; hence (as in the darknesse of the aire) men are troubled with strange and mishapen apparitions,
 
which they veryly beleeve are reall visions, whereas indeed they are but phantomes and imaginations of our brains, which upon the introduction of a candle are easily dissipated; even so in the intellectuall darknesse, men are troubled with uncoth and hideous opinions, beleeving and embracing them as reall
 
truths, whereas indeed they are but illusions. 
 Morte obita quales fama est volitare figuras, 
 Aut quae sopitas deludunt somnia sensus. 
 Which upon the approach of the light of Scripture and Truth, do vanish into nothing. In this time when darknesse
 
hath overwhelmed the minds of many men, who are molested with strange fancies, which they call new lights, whereas indeed they are but the glating of rotten wood, or of glowwormes, or those skipping lights (which wee call jack in the candle) I have adventured to bring in this little tract, as a peice of
 
waxe candle, after so many bright torches, that men may be undeceived, and that the true abjects both of faith and practice may be manifested; to which small peice J have prefixed your Lordships name, as being bound in the obligation of duty and affection to Your goodnesse and eminent parts
 
in generall; whose knowledge, judgment, conscience, and sincerity are such, and so well known, both at home and abroad, as they need not the help of any pen; so likewise, J am tyed by this small mite to expresse my gratitude, in particular for your Lordships favorable aspect on, & respect to me;
 
which I cannot better testifie, then by acknowledging my selfe. 
 Your Lordships humble Servant to command
ALEXANDER ROSS.
