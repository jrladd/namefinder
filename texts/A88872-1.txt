 
 TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE the Lord Major of the City of  London,  the Right Worshipfull the Aldermen and the rest of the Common-Councell. 
 T He Character set upon our English Nation by Strangers is, To have excellent Lawes, but no execution; like Pictures curiously drawne, well faced, and lim'd, but want life, and motion: They say likewise we have good materialls, but bad orders; little care, and abundance of idle and lewd people; few Cities, and those ruinous, basely built, thin of Inhabitants, and most of them poore; and all caused through idlenesse and want of imployment. 
 And now since these unnaturall Wars begun, the miseries of the poore doe much more abound, wherefore upon the earnest desire of some Charitable and wel affected friends, I have here presented some Propositions to the high Court of Parliament,
 and likewise here unto you in whose power the promoting of so wonderfull necessary a worke doth lie. It is a saving of the Soules and lives of many thousands, which through want of imployment fall to lewdnesse, and so perish: for there is no vice, villany, murther, or mischiefe, drunkenesse and disorder, but Idlenesse doth contract it, nor is there any way to cure it but by imployment. 
 It is a worke never yet paralleled nor begun by any your predecessors, and will render you famous to posterity; It is pleasing to God, an honour and benefit to the City, and will be a patterne for the whole Kingdome, nay for all the Kings Dominions to follow, which is the great desire of 
 Your friend and servant,  LEONARD LEE.
