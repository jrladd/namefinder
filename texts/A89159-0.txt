 
 
 TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE, CHARLES. PRINCE OF GREAT Britaine, Son and Heire apparant to our Soveraigne Lord, CHARLES, King of Great Britaine, &c. Long happinesse in this, and eternall blessednesse in the next world. 
 Most gracious Prince, 
 I T hath pleased your Highnesse to honour the Company of the Artillery Garden, by vouchsafing to be their Generall; wherein you have so endeared and obliged them to your service, that upon just occasion their lives and blouds are for
 your defence, ready tobe laid down. To whom then doe I owe this Dedication, if not first to your Highnesse? which if your Grace deigne to take into your Princely Patronage, I have the utmost of my ambition. My weaknesse (I confesse) forbad me to aspire so high, but your Gracious clemencie invited me thus far: And indeed you may challenge it as a due debt, (if it were worth the owning) it being the first Sermon preached since your Highnesse so much honoured the Company. You have a great Part to act, (most excellent Prince) when God shall please to call you to it, whose word will teach you to governe your selfe and people; to rule justly; and amongst the Courtly adulations and crouchings, not to be lifted up, but
 to remember your selfe to be but man; not so much to consider how great you are, as how good you should be; to acknowledge your power to be lent you for the advancement of Gods true worship; to love God more then your earthly dominions; to punish slowly, to pardon easily; to bend your revenge more for the Commonwealths safety, then to satisfie your owne desire; to mollifie sharp Decrees with the lenity of mercy; to desire to command your selfe, as well as others; to subject your own passions to Reason, as well as men; to remember that you rule over men; that you must rule according to Lawes; that you must not alwayes rule, but one day be called to your accompt before the supreame
 Judge of heaven and earth; and having ruled well, to receive an immortall Crowne in his everlasting Kingdome. VVhich shall be the prayer of 
 Your Graces humbly devoted, 
Matthias Milward.
