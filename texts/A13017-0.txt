 
 
 TO THE RIGHT Honorable, HENRY Earle of  Holland,  and Baron of  Kensington,  chiefe Gentleman of his Majesties Bedchamber, chiefe Justice, and Justice in Eyre of all his Majesties Forests, Chases, Parkes, and Warrens on this side  Trent;  Chancellor of the Vniversitie of  Cambridge;  Constable of the royall Castle of  Windsor,  one of his Majesties most Honorable privie Conncell, and Knight of the most noble order of the Ga ter. 
 Right Honorable, 
 A  Debtor I acknowledge my selfe unto the Church of God by calling, & a speciall
 
ingagement lieth upon me, both of trust and promise to serve the Church in this way, in bringing towards the furtherance of the building of it, that which hath beene squared and framed to my hand by a wise Master builder, who hath showed himselfe approved unto God, a workeman that needeth not to be ashamed. This I doe here humbly present unto your Honours protection; I may perhaps from some, incurre the censure of too much boldnesse in using
 
your Honours name, but your courtesie and sweet affabilitie springing from your native gentelnesse of disposition doth secure me: and the rather since I present this unto your Honour, not in my owne name, but in the name and behalfe of the Widdow, who though she may claime the priviledge of her Sex from appearing in Print herselfe, yet shee is desirous that the living and lasting Monuments of her deare husband should be brought
 
forth for the good of Gods Church, under the patronage and protection of your Honour, to whom the Author was every way so much oblieged; now I have no reason to doubt but that as your Honour was pleased to take the Reverend and learned Author into the protection of your noble family, for you will bee pleased to countenance these his owne legitimate children, which are now sent abroad as Orphans deprived of their father.
 
Their owne worth cannot but gaine them esteeme, but I know your Honour will prize them the more for their fathers sake: who whilest hee was alive did secure your Honour by his Prayers which he did daily offer up to God, not  pro forma  as a legall and dead ceremony, but  pro Anima,  as a spirituall and lively sacrifice, in the behalfe of your honour and happinesse, and now that he is dead yet speaketh in these and those other
 
Sermons of his which beare your honours name. If you be pleased to patronize, countenance and peruse them, they will reflect much brightnesse upon your noblenesse, as they receive splendour from it. Thus under your Honours protection I doe present them unto the world, humbly craving the priviledge of your pardon for my boldnesse, and heartily beseeching the Lord to mak you still and still to doe worthily in  Israel  and
 
to inrich your Honour more and more with grace here and glory hereafter. 
 Your Honours humbly devoted in all duty and observance,
A. B.
