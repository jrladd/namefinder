 
 
 TO THE RIGHT WORTHY AND EVER HIGH ESTEEMED, Mr. RICHARD COMPTON, Esquire, perpetuall health and prosperity. 
 T He many obligations (honored Sir) which your deserving actions have made me servant to draw mee to another engagement, which is no lesse noble, then those boundlesse bounties, which you so oft have conferred upon me: Therefore I now become an humble petitioner, th t your good liking will protect mee from the detraction of all Mom sts and Zoylans; and in so doing, I shall not feare that any one will say this my off-spring is
 
illegitimate, because your favourable eye not onely nullifies the malice of all adverse wills, but addes baptisme to this innocent, which here lies mute, wrapped up in the purity of white sheets: nay more, your gentle worded censure confirmes the same, and inlists it in the roule of Fame and Reputation. Admire then this small pension of my braine with mild benevolence, so may you adde courage to a young beginner, and make his Labour immortall by your smiling favour; for except this modell find mercy in your kinde acceptance, the creation, which I bestowed upon it, was onely to make it nauseall to all mens stomacks, and me ridiculous, because I ever observed your word to be of more value, then ever my merits could reach unto; then what is it that Your countenance will not perswade, if You please to adde but a few sillables to make your will appeare?  Si dicas, factum est.  If I thought or knew not your power to be prevalent in this which I request, I would not have so audaciously adventured to sollicite any such curtesie;
 
but I am confirmed of this knowledge, and confident of your ever too little praised good nature, which is a perfect spark of that heavenly goodnesse which giveth all things, because Your chiefe desire is to helpe Your friend with all sort of encouragement possible, and communicating Your best endeavours to the bettering of all those that strive to deserve: And therefore I am confident I shall finde You my firme and reall Friend, to gaine that benevolence for me, for which I will ever remaine 
 Your faithfull servant,  IO. IOHNSON.
