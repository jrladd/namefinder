 Right Honourable, and Right Worshipfull,  &c. 
 W Hereas you have been pleased (for the great ease and benefit of the Merchants of this Honourable Citie) to imploy me for that purpose, to procure a Court of Merchants here, (as may appear by a Petition of all the Merchants   in generall) which Court is the usuall Custome in  France,  (as appeareth by their own Printed Book for that purpose) which said Book, after a long and diligent search, I have with much labour and charge, translated, and procured leave from the Parliament to Print and Publish. And I hope, what is done, will be to your good liking: And if the businesse shall be prosecuted, so as to be wholly effected, I fear not, the result will prove it to be an acceptable indeavour, from 
 Your Servant  Peter Mitton.
