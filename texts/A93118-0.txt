 GENTLEMEN. 
 I  May perhaps have been so long out of your sight that I may be also by this time out of your minde. Neverthelesse it is not out of my mind, that I having received the seed and growth of that little knowledge in the lawes of this kingdome which God hath given me in the seed-plot of your ancient and honorable Society, doe no lesse (by a naturall equity) owe the fruit thereof to you then the Rivers doe their tribute to the Ocean, and the trees their fruit to the planters and pruners. This therefore (such as it is) although unworthy of so great a name, I am bold to dedicate to you, and put forth under the shelter of your favourable wings; beseeching you to accept thereof, and my well meaning therein, and to honour it with your patronage and countenance. And it shall much oblige, 
 (Gentlemen,) 
 Your most humble Servant W. S.
