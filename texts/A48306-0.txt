 RIGHT WORTHY SIR, 
 T His short discourse ensuing (though long enough I hope to resolve the Question proposed) is Yours by right of Dedication (now it is publick) since it was Yours before by causality of production (as a private manuscript) for your letter to your Reverend Æ²ncle (my honoured
 Friend) and his to me, have been unto it, as a Grandfather and father, from whose motion and sollicitation it is lineally descended. Accept it then (good  Sir ) as your owne: and me with it, whom Your immanent merit in your self, and transient benignity to me, have long and deeply obliged to remaine 
 Yours, to love, and serve  You,  with affection and fidelity. JOHN LEY. 
 From my lodging at the Fountaine in S.  Pauls  Church-yard.  Febr.  24. 1640.
