 
 TO THE HONORABLE THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, AND Burgesses of the House of Commons Assembled in PARLIAMENT. 
 Most Renowned Worthies, 
 T His  Antiteichisma  stands under high Protection fortified. Opposition it had, and shall have still. But your honour advanceth Truth, and nothing more. Nothing hath beene more obscured is seene, and how. Age doth not, cannot wrinckle her. Where the clouds of Sophistry be dispelled, her Face shines with beauty. To begin this
 
beliefe, J published this. The common charmes of superstition take not me. Whereat J aime, the marke is hit. J beseech you embolden me, and I can speake plaine. Whilest the close followers of Truth and Peace are pursued, the two sacred Sisters be forced by Humorists. And so impetuously, as if their being present were the present being of incendiaries. A strange Paradiastole: observe it, I have done. Be You ever under the divine influence, and J 
 the humblest of your Servants, THO. BARTON.
