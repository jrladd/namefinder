 
 
 TO THE MOST NOBLE,  HENRY JERMYN  Esquire, Master of the Horse, to the QVEENES Most Excellent Majesty. 
 SIR, 
 I  Hold it no Sacriledge, after the Example of our
 Fore-Fathers  of the  Old  Testament,  (whom the
 Law  enjoyned to offer their  First-borne  unto the LORD.) to present you, as my  Rightfull Lord  with the  Premisses  and  First-Fruits  of the spare Houres, J lately spent in the Translation of the ensuing Discourse: For, J know none, after the
 King,  and the  Right Honourable Your Father,  unto whom I owe this due, but  Your Selfe:  Since,  His Majesty   hath set so great a  Value  on  Your Merit, Vertue,  and  Birth,  as to designe  You  to the  Government  of that  Isle,  where J tooke my first Breath, and where the  Right Honourable Your Father,  makes the Inhabitants to live in a  Golden Age:  whereby they are bound to lift up their joynt Votes unto
 Heaven,  for  His Majesties Long and Flourishing Raigne
 in Health and Happinesse;  who doth afford them, so
 Good  &  Wise Governours,  and those continued in a
 most Noble Line;  so as I acknowledge myselfe divers waies obliged to dedicate unto  You  this small Labour: First, as to my
 Rightfull Lord,  being confident, that in imitation of the  Right Honourable Your Father, You  will cause the said Jnhabitants, to enjoy the  like Peace and Plenty, under  Your  Government: next, as Holding my small Patrimony and Fee, immediately from  You,  whilst  You  represent the  Kings Majesty  there: whereunto may also be added, the infinite Obligations J owe  You  in particular; whereby J reape this further advantage, that slaunderers cannot justly say, that J have any further end herein, but onely to render
 You   most humble thankes, for the benefits have already received, from  Your Generosity.  Besides, I am confident, that
 Your  Name appearing in the Frontispice of this Booke, will serve to Protect it, from the malice of those, who would disallow the Authour for being a Spaniard, which J assure my selfe, will be no lesse acceptable in this Court in the English habit (being countenanced by
 You,   who seeme to be the  Moecenas  of Strangers) then he hath beene in  France,  clad according to the fashion there; where he hath passed the Presse, without other, then Vniversall Patronage: For, seeing his chiefe aime, is, to suppresse Vice, and to open a path to Vertue, (though in a Satyricall way,) his designe and mine cannot but take effect. Since, detesting Vice,
 You  possesse Vertue it selfe, and are no way  like unto those Courtiers, of whom he speakes in this Treatise: otherwise, that  Great Queene  (whose  Life  may much rather be Admired, then Imitated) had not elected  You,  for the discharge of one of the Most Honourable Places in  Her  Service. Finally, as  You  are borne to bee  Happy  on  Earth,  that  You  may likewise bee so in  Heaven,  shall bee the  constant Prayer of him who is, 
 SIR, 
 Yours most obliged, most obedient, and most honouring Servant, EDVVARD MESSERVY.
