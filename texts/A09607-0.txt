 
 
 To the Ladyes and GENTLEVVOMEN  of  ENGLAND. 
 I  Custome did not enforce a Complement of Dedication; yet this Booke would desire to insinuat into the affection of  Ladyes  and  Gentlewomen;  since it can arive at
 
no greater perfection of happinesse than your favour, which it most earnestly desires. Let other workes covet their Patrons and Maecenasses, to derive from them a golden sprinkling of their bounty; whilst this shall expresse an ingenuity beyond such vulgarintents, and in a brave and free manner sacrifice it selfe to your acceptance and service; desiring only that you would grace it
 
with the influence of your propitious smiles, which cary in them a secret power, not only to cherish and advance the object whereon they reflect, but also to endeare it into others opinions, and make it precious in their estimations. Jn requitall of this your favour, it shall bee alwayes ready to furnish you with the best expressions of choise complementall language, for though by nature and custom,
 
you can deliver your minds in a smooth and gracefull manner; yet from hence, without study, or praemeditation, you may command necessary Ceremonies. Besides, your Ladyshippe's Chambermaids and waiting-Gentlewomen are to be pitied; who having by their good cariage compassed Suters, are often constrained to blush, in ignorance, for want of Complements, wherewith to answer
 
them. Let therefore this one instance, instead of more which might be inserted, perswade your intelligible, generous dispositions to receive this Booke once more as your devoted servant, and to honour it with your favour; which I shall esteeme as an exaltation to the supremest sublunary felicity, and the highest terrestriall happines.
