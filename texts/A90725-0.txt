 T He Reformation of England,  is the great expectation of the world, I thinke  I  may say of Angels, as well as men; and  the Parliament of England,  under God, is the great hope of the Christian world, to bring this reformation about. If any would set himselfe to study abstractly, how God might prepare a company of men to carry on such a worke, he would not easily finde out any thing, which God hath not already fitted the Honourable Houses with.  Great pressures  to helpe to make them humble before their meeting:  Manifold dangers  all along from the beginning of their meeting to helpe keepe them humble:  A mighty concurrence of providence  to necessitate their meeting together: And  an unparalleld overruling of hearts,  for their continuance together, without limitation of time, oother then their owne prudence should determine:
 A watchfull eye, and a strong hand,  to preserve them from all sorts of attempts, to dissolve their meeting:  Marvellous and manifold actings of Gods almighty power and richgrace,  in making their enemies fall before them, notwithstanding their frequent expectations, and most probable hopes of swallowing them up suddenly,  and in making the people every where to stoope  to every part of reformation by them promoted, notwithstanding all their habituated and doted on customes to the contrary;  the most solemne engagements  to carry the worke on for God, and accordingly to God, that are to be found upon earth, or are directed by heaven:  A spirit of reformation  in the hearts of many thousands throughout the Kingdome, and more particularly neer unto the place of their siting, breathing out prayers and supplications to God for them day and night, with giving of thanks, that the reformation may prosper in their hands, and be perfected by their hands: And finally,  most frequent entercourses between God  and  them,  by his sending to them, (and even directing them to call to themselves) his servants in great variety and frequency; to pray with them  daily,  to fast and pray with them  monthly,  (besides extraordinary dayes of  humiliation,  and to pray and give thanks with them upon extraordinary dayes
 of  thanksgiving,  and these extraordinary dayes both of the one and the other sort being not a few, put them altogether) and upon all these publike and solemne occasions,  to speake to them  in the name of God, words of direction & incouragement,  and all this as a joynt body together,  with the advantage of having every affecting Sermon perpetuated to them,  by Printing such  as they see cause, orapprove; (while in the meane time the severall members have the opportunity of constant hearing from God  every Sabbath,  and many of them  every morning. )  And with all this to have a selected number of men,  c sen by themselves,  to attend years together, meerly   giving them advice  about this reformation; may  I  not now say in the close of all,  what could have been done more  for such a company of men, to make them willing and able to do Gods whole work for his Church and people, for a full and perfect reformation? 
 And is not this your story (honourable and worthy?)  is it not the manifest story of Gods providence  toward the Parliament of England?  And what doth he now expect  from you?  Or what may we expect further  from him?  Surely  from him,  for my part I can expect no less, but that his intents are (though yet through some further difficulties perhaps) to carry  your spirits,  and the spirits of  the whole Parliament 
 strongly and powerfully on, to finish this so blessed a work. He hath pardon, & grace, & wisdome, and strength enough to answer and overcome all that can be said or thought to the contrary; in this perswasion I have  divers  years lived, and I hope in it I shall dye, if I must dye before the work be perfected; this perswasion and hope, as it directed me to choose for you this text, which is here discoursed upon, so it commanded me to speake what I could understand God expected, & doth still expect from you: wherein as for the generall, I am sure I have pointed you to the whole councell of God; so for the particulars I blesse God that I can say, your selves have manifestly owned divers of them, in making some Ordinances accordingly, and that addes to my confidence and comfort, that all other things of Gods will towards you, shall be fulfilled by you, according to his will from time to time; in which work, both by prayers, and all faithfull endeavours in my station, I am, and shall ever be in him, 
 Your most humble, and most devoted Servant,  Herbert Palmer.
