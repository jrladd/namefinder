 
 
 To his ever Honoured Uncle,
HENRY SHELLY Esquire, one of the
Members of the Honourable House of
COMMONS in PARLIAMENT
Assembled. 
 S Ir, 'twas not the hope of
adding either to your houour,
or my owne profit,
(but my certaine knowledge
of the encouragement
which any pious endeavours
shall receive
from your religious selfe)
that made me not hazzard, but presume on your
acceptance: were my Position contrary to what it
is, I might then be sencible of a fear, and suspect
its welcome; because I am confident that nearnesse
of relation cannot bribe your judgment, no not to
 
purchase but a slight view from your observing eye.
But being as it is, no way contradictory to what I
affirmed before: I hope it will not breed in you the
least suspition of a change in my affections: Sir my
hope of your acceptance, is not grounded upon the
agitation of so poore a principle, as that of Kindred,
for I am sure that your judicious and alwayes just
censure, will not be pleased with that from me,
which from another would prove distastefull; therefore
(for my part) I shall not be refractory, but submit
to your profound judgement, and whether you
approve or disprove, I shall still remaine what  I 
ever was, 
 Your faithfull Servant
and Nephew,
PETER BLAND.
