 
 
 TO THE
HONORABLE HOVSE
OF
COMMONS,
Assembled in
PARLIAMENT. 
 Y Our Command giving me the opportunity,
I took the boldnesse to urge and encourage
you to  Church-Reformation, 
(which is the maine scope of this Sermon)
a subject which otherwise (and in all
other Auditories) I have beene silent in, and am no
whit sorry for it: For I account it the most fit and happy
season to utter things of this nature unto  Authority 
it selfe, (although the people likewise are to know their
duty.) My comfort is, that what I have spoken herein,
 I have  (for the generall) (and I have spoken but generalls)
long  beleeved,  and  have therefore spoken. 
 You were pleased so far to owne me, as to betrust me
 
with this  Service,  to be Gods mouth in publique
unto you; and also this Sermon of mine, as to command
the publishing of it. Wherefore as in propriety
it is now become  yours,  more then mine, or all the
worlds: So let it be in the  use  of it. If it shall adde
the least strengthening to your resolutions, to  keepe
this purpose for ever in the thoughts of your
hearts,  I have what I aimed at. Goe on,  (worthy Fathers,
and Elders of this people)  and prosper in, yea
by this work; without which, nothing that you doe
will prosper.â€”But the rest I shall speak to God
for you. Let me be known to you by no other thing then
this, To be one, whose greatest desires, and constant
prayers are, and have been, and utmost endeavours (in
my spheare) shall be for the making up the divisions
of the Church in these distracted times  with love of
Truth and Peace:  And therein (to use  Davids 
words) am 
 Wholly at your commandment,
Tho: Goodwin.
