 T He Scriptures frequently tell of a wealth, a plenty, a fulnesse, which beleevers onely have right to, and injoy. The best endeavours of your humble Servant hath been (both in the Pulpit, and the Presse) to set this before you: that in all Your relations, in all Your injoyments on earth Your Soul might be carried forth after this abundance which in the Scriptures language is not onely true, durable, riches; but honours too. 
 Ever Honoured, pardon me if I humbly move to be heard in this:  viz.  remember, O! remember in
  all Your uses of this worlds plenty principally to use this abundance: for by this alone can You be made for ever rich, for ever Honourable. 
 And I bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, that in all Your uses of this abundance, You may use it as Your own. That  Solomons  Proverb may for ever be Your  impresso, with me are riches and honours.  Thus he daily prays, who is, 
 Madam, 
 Your Ladiships lowest Servant in Christ Jesus.  Thomas Sterry.
