 MADAM: 
 T He many obligements in which I acknowledge my selfe tyed unto your honours honourable husband (who hath been Gods gracious instrument in preserving me from the unjust oppression of the perverse; though I be not repaired in my sufferings) have made me humbly to present unto your Honour (as a true token of a gratefull minde) this little Tractate; short, as might be, shunning obscurity; and plaine according to my best possibility. Though  Momus  carp,  I  care not: The Word of God is not bound. Receive, honourable Lady, this mite from him who daily doth plead at the Throne of Grace for your honours honourable husband, for your honourable Ladiship; And happy hopefull Children: And who is really, 
 Madam, 
 Your Honours humble servant in the Lord, WILLIAM MORE.
