 M Ay it please your Grace. The advantage this slight worthlesse piece aimeth at, in this addresse, is of great consequence, but of a civil and moderate nature. It is no marvel if it desire to go forth under so
  great a Name, that is not like to appear considerable to the world otherwise. But the Countenance it demandeth, is according as the cause may deserve: more it must not expect from your Justice, lesse it cannot expect from your Goodnesse. If it fail of the Truth, it is a Child rebellious to the Fathers intentions, and according to the Law of Moses, here he bringeth him forth to receive his doom. If it have any thing considerable in a Cause wherein the world is so well informed
  long since, my suit is, that from your Graces hands it may be derived to the publick. The Lord of Heaven and Earth blesse your Grace with happinesse of this life, and of that which is to come. So prayes 
 Your Graces most humble Chaplain,  HERBERT THORNDIKE.
