 T Hese Poems (true and Noble Friends) being some expence of my time at Sea, I have thus habited, to present them as my true love to you on the Land. In one morning J present you with two poems. They are Virgins that never before kist the Presse, yet now come ready prest to kisse your hands. J have phrased them rather with a native familiarity, then an impertinent Elegancy, least by disregulating Art, J had made nature monstrous. Yet where the dignity of the subiect duely invites a higher-valued language, J have (to my ability) endeavored
 
a redemption. Were I versd in the tricke of flattery, I should have Deckt my dedication with some protestations of your worthinesse and my love But I suppose honest faithfulnesse rather blemished then embellishedwith those adulterated beauties; Favour mee to read this Messenger of my love; and more, to Accept it as the fruites of those faire respects in which (as J euer was) I am alwaies, 
 At your commandement a servant, ROB. DAVENPORT.
