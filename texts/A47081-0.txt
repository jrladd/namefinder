 
 To the VVorshipfull and  worthily honoured  HERBRT PRISE  Esquire, one of the Queenes Majesties Gentlemen Sewers. To his Vertuous, Religious, and Zealous Wife, the Lady  Goditha Prise,  heretofore one of the maids of her Majesties privy Chamber, and to their onely Child Mistresse  Henriete Maria Prise,  one of her Majesties GOD Daughters. 
 MOst blessed three, one God, Divinity 
 Protect thy number (sacred Trinity) 
 To whom I prostrate here thy gift, my will, 
 Grant them O Lord the peace of Conscience still, 
 True honours grace (thou knowst) I as a Bird 
 Escapt the Foulers snare when death was fear'd, 
 My braines being chrusht, my Temples crackt, I fled 
 From thence, and by a blessed Angell led; 
 The Spirit of grace, my faith, my hope reviv'd, 
 And for these seaventeene yeares hath me repriv'd 
 From death, to shew the world Gods gift, this Story, 
 That Sabbath-Breakers might behold my glory; 
 And Gods elect may see the reason why 
 I was so plung'd in dreadfull misery: 
 The truth it doth declare at large, and how 
 Upon repentance God doth mercy show: 
 This gift is his, which humbly I present, 
 In hope you'l please t'accept the good intent 
 Of him who praise, Your honoured dayes, May Zealous be, Eternallie. His life is yours While heart endures.  THOMAS JONES.
