 M Ost vertuous Lady, yea, Vertue it selfe, under whose protection to endeavour is most safe: and therefore that is here my most humble suite. I have, as insues, taken in hand to insist upon, or rather to deale with most peremptory, stout, and turbulent  Passions.  My incounter with such, being countenanced by your selfe, shall minde the more happy successe. Which favour, deare Lady,
 
shall for ever prove my incouragement, and approve your courtesie, under the shadow of whose wing I shall be sheltred as I walke, from all the searching heat, of accusing hatred; issuing forth the infernall furnace of detraction. 
 Thus farre presuming, it is, doubtlesse, my duty, to vow you my service: in the performance of which, where I shall faile in act, I trust to fulfill it in desire, and for ever rest. 
 Your Honours to Command, So long as mine owne to obey: 
Edward Calver.
