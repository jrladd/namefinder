 
 
 TO
THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE,
MOST WORTHY
and Noble Lords, the Noble-men,
and others of the Covenant
of  Scotland. 
 May it please your Lordships, 
 A Ccording to your honours directions, the
Scouts (which were sent into  England, 
to discover the estate of things
there) came unto me their Intelligencer
at  London,  who have collected
together all such observations, as they
in their severall travels have found, or my selfe observed,
either in my owne aboad now two yeares at  London, 
or in my returning home: But by reason of all
 
passages now shut up at sea, and all Land wayes belayd, I
was forced to put my selfe in  Arminian  Attire, and so
came home through  England,  and so remayned some
certaine time in the Campe Royall, where my Collections
may manifest my love to my Countrey, and care of the
trust by your Lordships imposed upon me. But if my observations
be not answerable to your Lordships expectations,
I am heartily sorry: Yet, yee may see, I have not bin
altogether idle, nor will be more carelesse hereafter (as
occasion is offered) then formerly I have beene, and shall in
my Northern newes (which is also now in collecting) make
good what is omitted, and in confidence of your favourable
acceptance hereof, I rest, 
 Your Honours most humble
servant,
D. L.
