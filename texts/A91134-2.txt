 Continuance of what they have wisheth,  T. P. 
 Honoured Cousins, 
 T He Mariner so layes his Stody, that when his Ship hath got into  Neptunes  gentle embraces, it may not goe out againe: Before, I sent a worke which you liked, and with a gentle looke was pleas'd to peruse it, with a faire acceptance gave it welcome. Should I trust to another fate it might bee dangerous. Therefore since my former have sped so well, I have presum'd to honour with your Names this Dedication. If you but send faire weather this time, J shall ever bee 
 Your devoted Shipman,  Tho. Prujean.
