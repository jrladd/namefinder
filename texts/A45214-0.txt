 Most dread Soveraigne, 
 Y Our Majesty was pleased to cast a gracious eye upon a late  Humble Remonstrance,  made to the High Court of Parliament, bemoaning the lawelesse frequence of scandalous Libels, and modestly asserting the true right of  Liturgie  and  Episcopacie.  I little thought that so meek and gall-lesse a Discourse could have irritated any the least opposition; But now, I find to my griefe, that even to move for Peace, is
 
quarrell enough; and feele many fists about my eares, ere I could imagine to have offended. Occasion is taken from those quiet lines, to combine forces against the Cause I maintained. The quarrell is insolently managed by many unknowne hands; Yet, the riot of these impotent Assailants should not easily have drawn me forth, had I not perceived that their confident ostentation and proud carriage in this affray, hath won them some (how undeserved soever) opinion of skill, with their credulous Abettors; and thereby, some disadvantage to my just cause. As one therefore that hates to betray the truth by an unfaithfull silence, I doe cheerfully enter these lists; rejoycing to hope that Your Majesties Eye may be the Judge and VVitnesse of my successe. Neither shall it be displeasing to Your
 
Majestie, that Your most honourable Peeres, and most faithfull Commons, now assembled, shall see the injustice, and ungroundednesse of that bold Appeale, which was made to them, by my daring Answerers; whose Abilities I taxe not, but their Fidelity I must; as those who have sought foulely to abuse their implored Judges with false shews of mis-alledged Antiquity, and meerly colourable pretences of proofs: VVhich if I doe not make good to them and the world in this ensuing Discourse, let the blemish of reputation lead way to the sharpest censure upon the person of 
 Your Majesties zealously-loyall Subject,  The most humble Remonstrant.
