 
 
 TO THE REVEREND LEARNED THE PROLOcutor, Assossors, the Commissioners of the Church of  Scotland,  and the rest of the venerable Assembly of Divines, now sitting in holy Convocation at  Westminster. 
 Reverend Sirs, 
 According to my duty at your  divine entreaty,  I have reduced those  pious instructions  received from you, into such a  pleasing forme,  as I hope, shall not only  affect,  but abundantly  edefie  the people of this  Kingdome  under your  holy Jurisdiction;  for considering your  spirituall care  over them, and how your time hath been taken up wholy in the procurement of that  sacred Ordinance for Tythes,  wisely thought on before the  Directory,  for  he is an Infidell and denyeth the faith, that doth not provide for his family:  your late  humble Advice  digested into severall  Assertions:  your sore travill and paine you have daly ever since your  holy Convocation  undergon, to  bring to birth  his  Holynesse,  Sir  JOHN PRESBYTER;  and other your toylesome endeavours for the Henone of your  holy cloth,  I have therefore more willingly become your  Joyrnoman  to ease  your Burthen  in this  your toylesome time of Deformation;  and having thus prepar'd my  endeavoures,  fit for the  puolike vew,  I am emboldned to  Dedicate  them unto  your divine protection,  not doubting of the  sacred imposition of your hands upon them,  to sanctifie them unto the people, as,  truly Presbyterean,  that comeing  forth  with  your Classicall Authority,  they may obtaine a  reverent estimation  with them. And seeing I have made such a happy  beginning,  I doubt not of an  answerable encouragement  from you to  proceed  as I have begun, but a small matter will please  MARTIN,  if you  sanctifie  him with the  Benediciae  of a  Cornelian Benefice  of 400. l. per annum, to  knocke downe  the  Anabaptsts, Brownists,  &c. with your thumping, bumping,  Presbyterean, Classicall CLUB,  that shall suffice  pro tempore,  and withall to gratifie him with the De me of  Pauls  House that's but a small matter, it will become his  worship  very well for the present, and afterwards you may doe, as it shall seem best to your divine wisedomes aeeording to his best deservings therein; he is a singular man in such a busines, and wants nothing but  preforment;  you doe not thinke, neither doth it enter into your hearts, how  reverend Yongue MARTIN  can  thunder-thump  the  Pulpit,  O, he can  staer  most devnitly, raile and bawle most fervently, storme most tempestiously even till be  foame at mouth  most precisely; Oh how be can spetter't out! O these caused  Anabaprists,  these wicked  Brownists,  these Hecetickes, these Scismatickes, these Sectaries; O  MARTIN  hath it at his fingers end, ha's an  Vniversity man,  skild in the  Tongues and Sciences, and can sophistioue any Text, O he is excellent at false Glosses, and Scholasticke Interpretations, he can wrest the Scriptures most nearly, tell the people
 
it is thus and thus in the Originall, an excellent man to make a Presbyter!  and O  Bretheren,  if  MARTIN  thus delude the people & thrash those Hereticks in hope sure  MARTIN  shall be partaker of his hope, you will not  muzle the oxe that trendeth out your corne;  no,  MARTIN  hath better esteeme of the  Assembly,  he doth not once suppose, that like  Bell's  Assembly of Priests they'l devoure all themselves, and leave nothing for  MARTIN,  but it is no matter,  MARTIN  will be content with hard meats rather then desert the service of such on holy, such a reverend Assembly, such a  Quagmire  of  croaking skip-jacke Presbyters,  such is his zeale and pious affection to the Cause, he is resolved to worke with his awne hands, rather then be troublesome: Thus committing his endeavoures to your  learned Consultations, pious Debates,  and  sacred Conclusions  he rests in expectation of his Reward, 
 Yours humbly devoated in all Synoddicall, Classicall, Consistoreall, or Predicatory Function, till death us depars,
Yongue MARTIN MAR-PREIST, Son to old MARTIN the Metrapolitane.
