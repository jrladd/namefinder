 
 
 TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFULL, Sir BENJAMIN RUDYARD, Knight, one of the Honourable House of COMMONS. 
 SIR; 
 A S formerly I have acquainted you with two small Treatises, which were dedicated to his  MAJESTIE  and the Right Honorable the High Court of Parliament, so now I have presumed on Christian affection, to dedicate this victory of Truth to your religious view and meditation. The odds in the conflict was much ten to one, and every one of them being roots of a thousand branches, even so many in number, and so grosse in nature, that if I should speak all I know of them, it might seeme incredulous to your exercised and experienced judgement, and prejudicious unto many that want the like knowledge and discernment, so that for this time I thought thus briefly to disarme the Leaders, that so the following multitude of the Army may have premonition before the time come that all the enemies of
 
Christ shall be slaine before him, and the secrets of all manner of hearts discovered. And for my own particular, Sir, finding the boldnesse and impudency of error, as well as the multiplicitie, whereby the whole Citie is in every part and place infected, and from thence, as from a fountain, the Countryes also, I could rest no longer silent, for as much as God of his own goodnesse and infinite mercy, hath been pleased to communicate and impart the knowledge of the mystery of his Word unto me in some measure, notwithstanding my own unworthinesse and weaknesse: this truth received in my heart, hath been as a fire which I could no wayes hinder from burning into a flame, through the light whereof, by the means of your grave and prudent countenance, he that reads it may have information of the evill and error without prefigured, and within this Treatise manifestly revealed; as also the good and happinesse of truth, the old path and straight way of the Lord, in some measure opened and declared; to which all that are not of the houshold of faith are strangers, and most of them perverters. And Sir, I pray of one thing take notice in the figure, that he that is most obscure in his person, is most dangerously subtill and mysterious in his doctrine; and at this very time, in which you sit in Parliament, with the whole Counsell of the Kingdome, he doth more hurt in one houre then in ten heretofore; his badge is  F.  Wherefore Right Wor: be pleased to take notice of the Churches enemies, and let the despised and persecuted wife of Christ, and her little children, have your love, helpe, and assistance. These are all that are intreated for to be granted by you, most vertuous and noble Senator, to him that is your faithfull and humble servant, 
 JOHN GRAUNT.
