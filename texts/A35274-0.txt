 
 
 To the Honoured
FRANCIS ROÆ²SE
AND
Thomas Boon Esquires,
Members of the Honourable House of
COMMONS in PARLIAMENT. 
 Honoured Sirs, 
 I T being the great
designe of God the
Father to set up his
Son our Lord  Jesus
Christ,  as his  King  upon the 
holy hill of Sion, and
(though the Heathen rage,
and the people imagine vain
 
things, saying, Come let us
break their bonds in sunder,
and cast away their cords
from us) to give him the
Heathen for his inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of
the earth for his possession.
 I say, this being Gods  design,
 he hath for the effecting of it, 
given all power and authority
in heaven and in earth into
his hand,  and accordingly 
Jesus Christ  hath undertaken
to  execute  all  Gods Decrees,
 which are mentioned in the 
Prophesie  of the Book of the 
 
Revelation,  where we finde
that  God  had  decreed,  that
for an  appointed terme  of 
time, his Church, his Temple,
his Saints  should be in
an  afflicted, persecuted, depressed,
low condition,  and
that  the Beast,  and  the Babylonian
enemies  of his  Church
 should have  power  to  grow
great,  and to  flourish,  and  to
make war against the Saints,
and to blaspheme God, and
his name, and his Saints,  for
an  appointed time  also, and
that after  that time  was expired,
 
that then  Jesus Christ
 should improve that  power
 that was for that end given to
him, in  giving a glorious Deliverance
 to his  Church,  and 
ruining totally the Beast,
 great  Babylon,  and all  his
enemies, That so the Kingdomes
of this world may
become his Kingdoms,  and
that in such a manner, as they
were not before, even so as all
that are in  authority,  that
will not  cast their Crowns  at 
his feet,  shall be  broken in
peeces,  for  he the Lord alone
 
must be exalted in that day;
there must be one Lord, and
his name one in all the earth.
 Now as it most clearly appears
to me from  the divine Oracles
 of  the Scripture,  having
compared  the works of God,
 and  his Word together,  I
have in  the ensuing Discourse
 held it forth (for  the
encouragement  of all  that
wait  for  the appearing  of the
Lord  Jesus Christ  for  the overthrowing
of his enemies,
 and  the deliverance  of  his
people  from  their persecutions)
 
 that  the time is already
come,  wherein  the appointed
time  of  the prevailing
power  of  the Beast  over 
the Saints,  is come to
a  period;  and accordingly 
Jesus Christ  hath begunne
to  bring downe  the  power
 of the  Beast,  and to lift up 
his Saints  out of  that low,
afflicted, persecuted condition
in which they have
beene, and that in order
 to the  perfecting  of these
things  England  is already 
fallen  from  the mysticall
 
Babylon, Rome. 
 Now,  Honoured Sir,
You  having been  glorious
Starres,  shining with a
great deal of  splendour  in
 Your Countrey  both in  the
publikenesse  of  Your spirits, 
and the  holinesse  of  Your
conversations,  wherein  You 
have been  eminent Examples, 
and  speciall encouragements 
unto others,
and knowing that it is the
 desire  of  Your souls  to see
the  Lord Jesus  alone advanced,
who-ever be thrown
 
down. I  have presumed  to
 present  this  little Treatise 
unto  You,  not  doubting  of
 Your ingenuous  and  favourable
acceptance  of  it. 
But though I  publish it  under
 Your name  and  favour,  yet
doe I not thereby  desire You 
to  patronize  any  thing  in  it 
(if there should be any  thing) 
that is  not truth,  and for  the
truth  that is in  it,  I need desire
no  Patron;  For  great is
the truth, and it will prevail. 
Yet notwithstanding
 the sonnes of truth,  as farre
 
as  the truth  appears to them
in  truth  will  own it,  and  contend 
for  it,  and doubtlesse so
will  You.  I am 
 Sirs, 
 A Petitioner to
heaven for  Sions, 
this Kingdoms and
your prosperity,
M. C.
