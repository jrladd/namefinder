 
 
 TO THE Right Worshipfull M r  JOHN EDEN OF  Ballindon Hall  in  Essex  Esquire, my godly Patrone. 
 Right Worshipfull, 
 H AVING  this small Treatise lying dead by me, or at least asleep; and being provoked to give it more roome and some breath, that
 it might be awakened by the Presse and Printers hand to come to light; I could not bethinke my selfe to make Dedication of it (as the use is) to any one more fitly then your selfe, and that for these reasons: First, you have been a good Disciple in the schoole of Piety from your very non-age, and education by that pious Lady your ancient Mother (whom I much honour) with the rest of that vertuous brood, some of whom it was my lot to seale up in their sepulchres, besides some of your owne. Secondly, you have been a constant hearer of these and other my Collations
 when you have been in these parts. Thirdly, you are my loving Patrone, by whose meanes and instigation, according to the desire of the Congregation, I was (some yeares since) brought to this place. Fourthly, I therefore am peculiarly ingaged unto you, and love not to live or dye wholly in debt, (I look to lay downe my tabernacle daily) accept, I pray, this small Testimony of Gratitude: I must say as  Peter,  Act.  3.6.  Silver and gold have I not, but such as I have give I you, a little plaine fruit of my owne grafting, I therefore dedicate
 it unto your selfe, and by you to my well-affected friends, my constant, conscionable, and profitable hearers: (Never more need of Faith and living by it, then in this terrible tempest) the blessing of the Lord goe with it. 
 Yours faithfully obliged in the Lord,  Timothy Rogers.
