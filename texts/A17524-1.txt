 Right Worshipfull, 
 A  Great book is a great mischief (as it is in the Greek Adagie) and therefore it was well said of  Seneca, Magni artificis est clausisse multum in exiguo.  Such an Artist the late great Generall the  Duke  of  Rohan  hath here proved himself, in his excellent abbridgement of  Cesars  warres, with his own observations upon them; and his  Militia  of the  Greeks  and  Romanes.  His work is like fruits which are dried in the sunne; contracted
 
to a small bulk, but full of substance and virtue. The transcendency thereof moved me to communicate it to our Nation in these times of action. May it please you to afford it your Patronage, and to accept it as a testimonie of all due respects from 
 Your most humble Servant,  J. C.
