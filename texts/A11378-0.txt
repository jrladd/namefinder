 
 
 TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES, PRINCE OF GREAT BRITAIN. 
 Most excellent Sir, 
 D Rawing my breath every day more happily by the favour I received from Your Royall Father, if my Pen should forget You, it had more Inke then either allegiance, or loyalty, or duty: The  Eyes  that I here present
 
Your. Highnesse, I confesse durst not looke his Majestie in the Face; He hath so much of  Caesar  about Him as strikes me into a  non possum ferre fulmen:  but Your Selfe, being yet a divine spark and ray from Him, and not ascended Your Meridian of Soveraigntie, is not become so awfull, nor so inaccessible. We may see that Sun in his Rising, whose Beames may at his Noone chide our weake eyes for the attempt: This Sir I speake of You, who is but now in Your East, having Your Noone-point before You, and may You drive
 
on happily to Your glory both in Your Heaven and Kingdome below, and the Kingdome of Heaven above. 
 And be pleased, Gratious Sir, to let these  Eyes  here light but a beame of Yours to the holy Scripture, and to ayre but Your Bosome at these  Flames,  and to suffer these Leafes, thus seeded with divine thoughts, to be a robe of holy Ermins to Your Soule: I lay my selfe and papers at Your Royall feet, and am 
 A Beadesman for Your Highnesse
J. Saltmarshe.
