 W Hen I entred upon the seventh  Verse  of this  Chapter,  (for there I first brake ground)  I  cannot say, that it was my purpose to have followed the  Baptist  to the end of his  Sermon.  But  Providence  leading mee along, it hath now brought me to the  Borders,  the middle clause of the l  Verse of it▪ Which when  I  fell in hand with,  I  can say, that it was farre from my thoughts to make my  Meditations  thereon any further publick, then as the Pulpit
 
rendered them. But finding the  Subject  seasonable for the times,  I  have beene induced to comply with the  desires  of some▪ and  approbations  of others, in sending them abroad, as  Noah  once did his  Dove  out of the  Arke,  when the  Earth  was covered with  waters.  What  entertainement  they shall meete with, or what  returne  they will make, as  I  know not, so neither am  I overthoughtfull.  It is  enough  for me, that  I  have endeavoured herein to  please God and not men,  otherwise then  in him,  and  for him.  My  desires (I  confesse) have beene, and are, that this my  service,  (if possible) might be  acceptable  to all. However, being a  Service for Ierusalem▪ I  doubt not but it shall be so to you, and all those  who pray for the peace  thereof; whose  I  am and ever shall be 
 Onely in the Lord
 John Brinsley.
