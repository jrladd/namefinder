 M Y  Miscellanies,  I offered, unto  Aaron  (your elder Brother) who is set over us, by our most gracious King; as a ruler of the House of God; I now thinke it convenient; to offer unto you, as to  Moses,  a second part of my Studies; such as they are, God blesse them to be, as a spurre to your devotion, and as a partiary meanes of your salvation; and then I have my desire, in this world. Let others joy in other matters: Your worth is knowne, you are inwardly indowed with an excellent spirit; able to discerne evill from good, shadowes from substance. To you therefore doe I flye; stand but you in the gap, and defend what I have written, I aske no more, and desire no lesse, as you knew the particulars study of my youth; and of late (to my wonder) recalled and recounted
 the very Bookes; in which they were written; so now I beseech your Honour to accept with portion of the Studies of my old age. Lastly, you vouchsafed to me many speciall particulars, whereof our Westerne parts take notice; which binds me for-ever to acknowledge, and be thankefull unto you; and to consecrate the best part of my indeavours to the honour of your name, which I pray to God, may be as glorious in heaven, as it is on earth; and that in the meane time, you may daily grow up more and more into favour with God, and his sacred Majestie, and as you doe with all good men. 
 Your Honors at Command to serve you, EDVVARD KELLETT.
