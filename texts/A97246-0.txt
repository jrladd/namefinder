 C Ourteous Reader, 
 The disease to which this Cure is applyed, is epidemicall. The hearts of men beeing anatomized, it will bee found, that the grand cause of their alienation from, and opposition unto the waies of God: is a secret obstruction, arising from that which as the seed of it, the Author calls  Misprision.  This Book describes the disease very lively, in the
 
Symptomes of it, and prescribes the Cure in a very artificiall method; laid downe in great variety of matter, and elegancy of conveyance. The receipt is made up of well chosen ingredients: strong, and therefore likely to be operative; sweet, & thereby inviting the patient to take it. If the  Jaundies  be removed out of thy eye wherby the things of God have been represented to thee in a false colour: Let the chief Physitian have all the glory of thy recovery, which is all the reward the confectioner expects for his paines. 
 THO: GOODVVIN.
