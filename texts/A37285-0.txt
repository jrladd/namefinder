 
 
 To the worthy Gentleman
Mr.  George Butler  professor of the
Arts Liberall, And true Patron to
Neglected Poesie, All Health and
Happinesse. 
 Worthy Sir, 
 I  May be thought bold, if not impudent,
(upon so little acquaintance)
to make this sawcy trespasse upon
your patience; But fame, whose office,
(like the Nomenclators at Rome) is to
to take notice and proclaime the Name and
vertues of every Noble Personage, has given
you out for so Ingenuous a professor of the
Arts, & so bountiful a patron of poor schollars
it has imboldned me, to present my Hive of
Bees to your favourable protection; and when
I remember how Lewis the eleventh (of that
Name) King of France tooke notice, & bountifully
rewarded a decay'd Gardiner, who preseÌ„ted
him with a bunch of Carrets, I doubt not
of their kinde and generous entertainment;
upon which assurance I rest ever. 
 Yours in all service devote.
JOHN DAY.
