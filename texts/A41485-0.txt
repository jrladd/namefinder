WORSHIPFVLL
AND MUCH
HONOURED
JOHN PYMME
 Esquire, 
 SIR, 
 I T is no part
of my designe
in this
Dedication,
by the reflexion of
smooth language, to
shew you yourselfe in
 
your glory, or to take
the worke of admiring
your worth, out
of the hands of all
the world, who are
now very intent, and
busie at it. If honour
and approbation will
pay debts, the Nation
(I conceive) is not
much behinde with
you, for all the service
you have done it: for
(as farre as I understand)
you have scarce
enemies enough, to
deliver you out of the
hand of that curse of
 
our Saviour,  Wo be to
you when all men speake
well of you, Luk.  6. 26.
I have no authority to
question the singlenesse,
and uprightnesse
of your heart, in
those notable and
noble engagements,
that are upon you:
yet if you will plead
your selfe to doe it,
the security attending
thereon, will beare
the charges. When
credit and conscience
are yoked, and draw
the Chariot together,
 
Conscience (ofttimes)
proves dull,
and heavie in the
worke, and if not
sometimes remembred
with the goade,
and put on, will suffer
credit to draw all on
the one side, and so
lay her fellow on the
wheele. It argues an
high, and excellent
frame of spirit where
a man can follow
with intensnesse of
minde, things that be
of good report, and
yet not be over-acted
 
with the goodnesse
of the report; but
fetch the strength of
that inspiration, by
which hee is carried
on in his motion,
from the goodnesse
of him that hath commanded
it. The more
God is interessed in
our intentions, the
more he is like to interest
himselfe in our
executions. If wee
make him a stranger
in the proposition of
our ends, hee takes no
pleasure to make himselfe
 
knowne unto us
in our prosecutions,
except it be by way
of opposition, and
rising up against us.
The royall method in
great actions, to
breake all difficulties,
and barre off discouragements
in sunder,
as with a rod of iron,
is to digge out of our
selves as much of our
earth, that is, as much
of our selves as wee
can come at, and fill
up the pit, or empty
place, with God and
 
zeale for his glorie.
The consecration of
an enterprise is soveraigne
against abortion,
whereas to
worke for a mans
selfe alone, is little
lesse, being interpreted,
than to betray
his action, and to
give security to his enemies,
that God
shall not build with
him, nor prosper him
in his way: and consequently,
that his labour
in building shall
be in vaine. 
 
The least offensive
(I am sure) and yet
withall, (with serious
and inside men) as
weightie a testimony
(as I conceive) as can
be given to your wisdome,
is to speake
thus in the plaine dialect
of the ancient
simplicity unto you,
and not to spare
you, as farre as the
truth may doe you
good. Neither doe I
conceive, wherein any
mans worth or
wisdome can do him
 
better service, than by
strengthening others
to lay on himselfe to
beare greater weights
of this treasure, than
men of an under-sufficiencie
are able to
stand under. 
 The Disciples themselves,
were great
loosers (for the time)
by their weaknesse,
in this kinde; they
wanted the sweete
company, and converse
of many high
and important apprehensions,
which
 
(doubtlesse) had bin
equall too (if not
much better then) the
society of so many
Angels, because in respect
of the present
infirmity of their spirits,
they were as unable
to beare the
strength of their influence
and working,
as the frailty of the
flesh and blood is, to
abide the glory and
presence of those Embassadours
of heaven.
Their gratious, and
great Lord and Master
 
himselfe, plainely
professed this unto
them:  I have many
things  (saith he)  to say
unto you, but you cannot
beare them now, Joh.  16.
12. And had they
not out growne this
weakenesse afterwards,
by meanes of
that golden showre
from heaven, wherein
they were rained
upon with the Holy
Ghost, and with power,
they had beene
kept fasting from the
feast of those fat
 
things (whatsoever
they were), all the
dayes of their lives. 
 The reason why
the world (so generally)
drinkes old
wine (in our Saviours
Metaphor)
which is of a lower
and flatter taste, is, because
their vessels are
not new, and strong:
and therefore not fit
to have new wine
(which is of a stronger,
and more lively,
of a more stirring,
working, and provoking
 
spirit) put
into them for feare of
breaking. Wee have
but the light of the
Moone instead of the
light of the Sunne, or
at most, but the light
of the Sun, instead
of the sevenfold light
of seven dayes, promised
 Esa.  30. 26.
shining to us, because
wee are tender eyed,
and inconsiderately
afrayd, lest an excellency
of knowledge
should undoe
us. 
 
Not to wrong (in
the least measure)
the rights of Heaven
in point of thankfulnesse,
due from us,
nor to quench the
least sparke of the joy
of our congratulations:
for the blessing
of knowledge powred
out unto us so abundantly,
above the
line and measure of
former ages, certaine
it is, that truthes of
highest importance,
and which should
joyne Heaven and
 
Earth neerer together,
and heale a great
part of that deplorable
distance, which
yet lyeth betweene
men and Angels, and
so advance and quicken
the spirituall entercourse,
and commerce
betweene the
two worlds, are little
stirring in the world.
One maine reason
whereof is, because,
as the Disciples of
Christ, when they
saw their dearest
Lord & Master comming
 
towards them
upon the water, were
sore afraid, and cryed
out, supposing he had
beene a spirit, that
had appeared as an
executioner of present
death upon
them, who yet was
the glory and crowne
of their security: so
many in the world
(no worse affected
neither, to the truth,
in generall, than
they were to Christ)
crie out, as men out
of measure troubled,
 
at the first glimmering,
and appearing
of some truthes unto
them, as if they were
the spirits of Devills
comming upon the
world, for the spoile
and ruine of the pretious
soules of men;
whereas, were they
capable of their inspiration,
and either
did, or were but inwardly
willing to
know of what spirit
they were, they could
not but acknowledge
and confesse, that
 
they were of the dearest,
and deepest, and
sweetest confederacie
with Heaven. It was
 Austines  complaint
long since:  Nonnulli
intelligentes citius volunt
exagitare, quod non
intelligunt, quam quaerere,
ut intelligant, & non
fiunt humiles inquisitores,
sed superbi calumniatores,
Aug. de Temp.
Serm.  72. I forbeare
to make English of
this Latine: because
the party chiefly interessed,
are (for the
 
most part) men of the
language. 
 But Sir, I consider
the weight and importunitie
of your
present imployments,
I know you are (with
your worthy Assistants)
about a great
and laborious cure,
(the Lord prosper it
under your hands)
and farre be it from
mee to desire, that this
should suffer in the
least, through any occasion
of mine. I had
not presumed thus
 
farre, but that this
little piece had stucke
in the birth some
yeares together, and
was well neere stifled,
found now a
way into the world,
by the providence of
God, and by the benigne
aspect, and influence
of that happy
constellation, wherein
your selfe shine as
a starre, in much glory.
And the subject
of it being of that
neere affinity and sympathy
with the soveraigne
 
piece of that
great worke you have
in hand, the rescue,
and advancement of
the Gospell, I should
(I conceive) have
turn'd my backe upon
that providence
which look't mee in
the face, if I should
not have presented it
to some of those
Worthies, whom
God hath anointed
with wisdome, grace,
and power, as for the
bringing of many
greater, and weightier
 
things to passe, so
(the event bearing
witnesse) for the helping
forth of it also
into the world. 
 In which great and
honourable assembly,
I knew not one,
whom rather to cast
mine eye for this dedication,
than on
your selfe, who, as
you are knowne to
the whole Nation, by
your worth and zeale,
for the things both of
God and Men, so
have you beene
 
knowne to my selfe,
heretofore, by some
more particular acquaintance:
the discontinuance
and decrease
whereof, I impute
onely to mine
owne unworthinesse,
and negligence in addressing
my selfe unto
you. 
 I doe not in these
meditations put you
upon any thing (in
the maine) but wherein
you have prevented
my motion, and
are already home-engaged:
 
I know you
are in for the Gospell,
with all your heart,
and with all your
soule, and if with all
these, with all whatsoever
besides. So that
you might (in that
respect) expostulate
with mee the impertinencie
of this my
addresse unto you, in
those, or such like
termes,  .
 What neede you
quicken him that maketh
haste?  Yet make I no
question, but that of
 
your selfe you know,
how fairly to salve
the seasonablenesse,
and usefulnesse here of
notwithstanding: In
which regard, an apologie
would prove
the impertinency, not
the Dedication. I verilly
beleeve, that  P 
never met with Christians
so abundant in
the worke of the
Lord, but still hee exhorted
them to a
bound yee more. 
 Besides, though I
cannot say with the
 
confidence of an intuitive
knowledge,
that you meete with
any secret feares, discouragements,
conflicts
of doubtfull
thoughts, and reasonings
with your selfe
in the way of that
contention for the
truth, which now you
sustaine: yet can I
hardly beleeve, but
that sometimes you
feele the activenesse
of the powers of
darkenesse against
you, and finde some
 
insinuations, and
grudgings, (if not
stronger, and sharper
fits) of feares touching
the successe, and
issue of your great
undertakings. In
which respect, I conceive,
it should not
be unseasonable altogether,
to administer
unto you, of those
excellent comfortations
and strengthenings
of heaven, which
the Holy Ghost hath
treasured up in the
Scriptures, for such
 
times, and occasions
(especially) as these.
The Lord Iesus Christ
himselfe, being in
deepe conflict, was refreshed
by the presence
of an Angell
from Heaven comforting
him,  Luk.  23.
43. The consolations
of the spirit in the
Word of God, administred
by a hand
consecrated thereunto,
have sometimes
beene little inferiour
in the glory of their
effects, to those of
 
Angelicall dispensation. 
 I dare not undertake
for any sapientiall
advantage you are
like to gaine for the
Faith, by the perusall
of these few pages:
I know if there bee
any to be gotten, you
will not overlooke it.
Yet give mee leave to
say this: that the
best and wisest mens
thoughts, apprehensions,
purposes, ends,
intentions in their
best actions, will never
 
lye right, and
straight in their bowels,
nor with that
ease and intimate satisfaction
to their
owne spirits, except
they be marshalled,
ranged, and composed
by the hand of
the spirit of God,
stretched out from the
Scriptures. 
 The God of grace
and glory, who
in your selfe, together
with that worthy
Senate of joynt
consultations with
 
you, hath opened a
doore of hope to a
Land and People,
brought very low,
and hath begun by
your mouthes to
breath upon the dry
bones, so that there
is some noyse and
shaking heard already,
bring them together,
bone to his
bone, and flesh upon
them also, in due
time, and cover them
with a skin, and put
a spirit of life into
them, that they may
 
live: and recompence
abundantly
into their bosome,
the labours and travells,
and faithfulnesse
of those, whose
hearts, and hands
have beene, and still
are lifted up to
the worke, that tasting
the presence,
and mightie hand
of God with them,
they may rejoyce as
strong men to runne
the remainder of
their race, and not
faint or waxe wearie;
 
till the great
breach bee repaired,
till the throne, and
kingdome of Iesus
Christ bee lifted up
on high, above the
rage, power, and
contradictions of
those, that seeke to
lay the glory of it
in the dust; till
judgement runne
downe like water,
and righteousnesse
as a mightie streame,
to wash; and carry
away all the filth;
and noysomenesse
 
of the Land, till
the hearts, and
mouthes of all those
who love the peace,
and prosperitie of
the Nation, bee filled
with joy, and
gladnesse, and the
faces of all that are
enemies unto it,
with shame, and
confusion. And for
your selfe, your
personall honour,
peace, and safety,
you have an interrest
in your selfe
(which sleepeth
 
not) in the prayers
of 
 Coleman-streete 
 Decemb.
the 4.
1640. 
 Your Worships
home-devoted
in the things of
Iesus Christ
