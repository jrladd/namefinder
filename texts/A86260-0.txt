 
 
 TO THE HIGH AND POTENT KING, CHARLES King of Great  Britaine, France,  and  Ireland,  health and happinesse. 
 (Soveraigne Lord,) 
 T Hey that are to treat with great Potentates and Personages are inioyned, to be short and sweet. Jf J faile in the last, I shall not misse of the first,— Ne longo sermone morer tua Tempora (Caesar.) 
 The last great Mortalitie, J published certaine Rules, and Directions, for the prevention of the spreading of that contagious, and all-devouring Sicknesse. Those briefe advertisements I have searched out, reviewed, somewhat inlarged, and brought forth againe, to the view and use, and I hope good of
  my Citizens and Countrimen. My presumption is, that though J shall purchase neither profit nor praise, yet J shall obtaine pardon of your Maiestie, if tendring the common good of my Country, I bring one pale-full, or rather dishfull of water, toward the quenching of the common flame.  Morbi (ut rectè Celsus Med. Latinorum Princeps) non curantur eloquentia, multo minus loquentia.  Especially this fierce Fury, which is  non Morbus, sed Monstrum, superans saepissime tum Artem, tum Naturam,  not a disease, but a Monster, over-matching, and quelling, oft-times both Art and Nature. The Lord of glory and mercy keep your Highnesse, with your most Honourable Councell from the rage of this man-slaying  Hydra,  and all other both open and secret evils and enemies, and make you a wise and skilfull Physitian to prevent the dangers, and cure the maladies of Common-wealth and State. 
 Your MAIESTIES humble subject and suppliant, FRANCIS HERRING.
