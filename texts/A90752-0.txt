 
 
 TO THE HIGH AND HONOURABLE COURT OF PARLIAMENT. 
 W Hereas I am confident, that this Honorable Court will lay the Corner Stone of the worlds happinesse before the final recesse thereof, I have adventured to cast in my widowes mite into the Treasurie; not as an Instructer, or Counsellour, to this Honourable Assembly, but have
 
delivered my conceptions in a Fiction, as a more mannerly way, having for my pattern Sir  Thomas Moore,  and Sir  Francis Bacon  once Lord Chancellour of  England;  and humbly desire that this honourable Assembly will be pleased to make use of any thing therein contained, if it may stand with their pleasures, and to laugh at the rest, as a solace to my minde, being enclined to doe good to the publick. So humbly craving leave, that I may take my leave, I rest this 25. of October 1641.
