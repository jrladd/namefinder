And To His Reverend and loving Brethren in Christ, the PASTORS and ELDERS of the Kirk of Scotland, met together at their generall Assembly appointed to be held at Saint  Andrewes  in July,  Anno  1641. The humble and earnest suit of JOHN DURY Minister of the Gospel of God, 
 Reverently and humbly sheweth, 
 T Hat seeing for the space of these ten yeers bypast, your Petitioner, as without all prejudice and partialitie against any Protestant Church or person; so with all favourable permission, good liking, approbation, and encouragements from chief men of all sides, whom in a Civill or Ecclesiasticall way it doth concerne, hath solicited the work of reconcilement amongst Protestants: wherein he is gone so farre, as in a private Theologicall way
 
of Treaty may bee proceeded with forraign Churches, to prepare their mindes unto further resolutions in due time. And now finding, by Gods good Providence, an opportunity of publick meetings, both here in England, where his solicitation is laid to heart; and also in his native Countrey and Church, where hopefully his purpose may be in like manner promoted by publick approbation and counsell of the godly, wise, and learned Ministery: 
 Therefore he thinketh it a part of his duty to deferre his humble respect unto your Reverend Assembly, intreating for the love of the Spirit, and by the Communion of Saints, that in the feare of God, so good an endeavour, though meanly hitherto countenanced, may not bee slighted; but that the scope and prosecution thereof may be taken up without prejudice, according to the true meaning thereof, which is laid open in the printed English Relation, and Latine Information herewith offered unto you: And that the writ given to M.  Alex. Henderson,  containing a draught of the particular means and manner of proceeding, wherein the way of your sued for concurrence is specified, may be taken seriously to heart, and some Declaration of Christian advice, and answer thereupon returned, which may conduce, and help to advance the glory of God through the unblameable and peaceable profession of the Gospel of  Jesus Christ  amongst Protestants: And I your Petitioner, as in duty bound, shall pray daily for your eternall and temporall felicity, and his Majesties long life, in a peaceable and prosperous Government over you, and all his Kingdomes.
