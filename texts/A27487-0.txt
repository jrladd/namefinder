 
 
 TO
THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE
THE LORDS, AND
The Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses,
of the Honourable House, of
COMMONS. 
 G Reat Senators  though in those stormy
times and Illiads of great affaires,
wee present to your Honours,
as one did to  Antipater  a
Treatise, the subject whereof is
Happinesse;   yet wee are Confident wee shall
have a better Answerthen  I am not at leisure.  Our
humble suit is, for the Pure Worship of the true
 God,  and the quite abolishing of the  Service-Book, 
with the Hierarchicall Maintainers of it, both
Enmity to  Christ,  Kingdome; this (as we conceive)
is the prime Worke of the day,  saving
health is the greatest good, Salus sum mum b num.  and Purity in Worship
is the onely meanes to attaine the End, and you
are  the Instruments of Instruments  to advance this   
 
Worke. We desire no more of your Honours,
but that the Reasons of our requests may be
weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary,  &


ut res cum re, Hicrom   & ratio cum ratione comparetur, 
that Matter with Matter, and Reason with
Reason (as a Father saith) may be compared,
and that which is found light may be cast out
of the Sanctuary. It suits neither with the Honour
of your Place, nor greatnesse of the work:
that you should either see with Dr.  Halls  eyes,
or with ours; but that Eye-clearing word,
should be the light of your Eyes, as we hope it
is: the Doctor his Charging upon  Gods  people
with Passionate reproaches, recoyles enough
upon himselfe; though  Tully  telleth us, that bad
Orators, instead of Reasons, Vse, Declamations,
we could not have expected it from so great an
Orator as the Doctor; we seeke not  Corban  nor
 Mammon,  as our adversaries doe, but the Kingdome
of  Christ  in the Purity of his Worship,
which is first of all to be sought; for Reformations
begins at the Sanctuary. You are those
 Eliakims  that must set the  Lord  upon his glorious
Throne, and hee will make  you as Nayles
in a sure place:  to whose Honours wee shall
ever he devoted, 
 In all humble Service.
