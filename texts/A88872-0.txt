 
 
 TO THE HIGH AND HONOURABLE Court of PARLIAMENT. 
 A Mongst the many and miserable pressures in this Kingdome, especially in this renowned City of  London,  idlenesse and want of imployment hath been the destruction of many, and as a pestilent malady it daily encreases. For prevention whereof, at the speciall instance and importunity of some Noble and Reverend friends, I heretofore presented some propositions to the Kings most Excellent Majesty for setting the poore aworke throughout the Kingdome; whereby all sorts of people, men, women, and children, aged and impotent, might be imployed, and relieved. Which His Majesty, together with the
 Lords of His Privy Councell commiserated, and ordered a speedy prosecution thereof. But by reason of the weighty and troublesome affaires of the State, at that time all such publique businesses were neglected. 
 And now again, upon the like importunity, and in a desire of the good of the Kingdome, and of this City, seeing the poore and their miseries encreasing together in these disasterous and tradelesse times, I have here presumed humbly to present some propositions and reasons conducing to the reliefe & imployment of the poore, which if they finde (acceptance to execution) it will bring a blessing to your selves, a benefit to the people, a reliefe to the distressed, and an honour to the Nation, which is the petition and prayer of 
 Your Honours Orator and Servant,  Leonard Lee.
