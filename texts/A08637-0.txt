 
 
 To his much honoured and most Worthy friend M r   John Ethredge,  Bachelour of Divinity, and Vicar of  Halsted  in  Essex. 
 Reverend Sir, 
 I  Am bold to present to your favourable acceptance and friendly patronage this worthy translation of  Ovids Festivals.  I will beg no pardon for my presumption herein, for that were to traduce a friendly office, and to question the candour of your ingenuous disposition. To you I commit this orphane Muse, which cannot die with the deceased Parent, but under your grave protection will grow up and flourish and wrestle with eternity. To my knowledge, the Authour of this Translation in the sincerity of his best affection
 
alwayes honoured you, and I am confident that out of the ingagements of those respects he bare you, had dedicated this his ensuing work unto you, had Fate lent him longer life, as a pledge and testimony of his undissembled love. To you therefore, most worthy S r , I send this his learned Posthume, which humbly imploreth your smile upon it and care over it, and that you would lovingly take it into the bosome of your courtesie and there cherish it. In so doing you shall engage the devoted gratitude of those friends it hath, and satisfie the earnest request of 
 Your most respective friend  Edward Albiston.
