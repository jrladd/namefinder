 
 TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL the  Mayor  and  Aldermen  of the City of GLOUCESTER. 
 Gentlemen, 
 I  Am constrained to publish an Answer to Mr.  Bacons  Relation, wherein both you, and the Ministers of your City with divers others, are vehemently traduced. It troubles me that  Gloucester  should come in question or be spoken of in such a slender businesse; yet since it is made publick I cannot neglect it. Besides, greater Events do take their first Rise from small beginnings: And I know not what influence that vain Relation may have on the publick, if it passe uncontrolled. Unto you therefore I tender this Vindication, and cast my self upon your Censure where these things were acted. I value my Reputation with you, and I trust shall still behold my native place with comfort, and the manifestation of a good Conscience, which I can never hope to do if mine integrity fail me. The Lord make you valiant for his Truth, and according to your power to avenge the Quarrel of His Covenant, and to contend for the Faith which was once given to the Saints. 
 Your Servant in the Gospel of Christ,  John Corbet.
