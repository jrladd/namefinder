 
 To the right worshipfull Sir  Thomas Glenham  Knight, one of the Deputie-Lieutenants, and Colonel of a Regiment in the countie of  Suffolk. 
 Right Worshipfull, 
 I  Make bold (incited by your many favours) to present you with a short  Treatise of Warre.  How well the Authour hath acquitted himself therein, Your worthy self (by reason of your known abilities, both for Theorie and Practice, in that profession) are best able to judge. And for my translation, your studies and travels having made that language naturall to you, I might justly fear a severe censure; but that I know your candour such, as you will excuse 
 Your obliged servant,  J. C.
