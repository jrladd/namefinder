 
 
 To  The Right Worshipfull, his much Honoured friend THOMAS PARKS,  Esquier. 
 SIR. 
 I F  Elisha  were at a stand, when hee considered what the good  Shunamite  had done for him, that hee askes 2 Kings 4.13. . What is to bee done againe for her? And  Ahasuerus  for  Mordecay, 
 
 
 
 
 
when hee had receaved a good turne from him that hee saies Esther.  6.3. , What hath beene done to him for this? How much more maie I saie of you, you have been beneficiall to mee from my Youth, What dutie and service shall J returne to you againe? J confesse that if there bee anie thing in these my weake labours that maie deserue acceptance, you maie justlie challenge it as your owne, Without whose bountie I had not lived in the  University,  nor attained to that small measure of knowledge that J have. And therefore (being able to doe nothing else)
 
J commit this  Sermon  to your Patronage and protection, and your selfe, your fruitfull Vine, and Olive branches to the protection of the  Almighty,  desiring him to give you the blessings of his Right hand, and of his left, to fill you with the blessing of grace heere, and of glorie hereafter. 
 Yours, to be commanded in Christ Jesus WILLIAM PARKES.
