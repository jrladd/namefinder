 
 
 TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY MONARCH CHARLES by Divine providence King of Great  Brittaine, France and Ireland, &c. 
 Y Our Highnesse may iustly condemne this as a high presumption, to present the most eminent King in the Christian World with a discourse of Petitions and Coppies of Letters: but I have found favour in your sight when I presented them unto your highnesse upon more dangerous tearmes, and therefore I trust that blessed Lord will move your heart still to accept of the hearty desires of your poore subject, though they be not clothed with the glorious ornaments of Wisdome and Eloquence, as was fit to dedicate to the view of so learned and judicious a Prince, but my comfort 
 
is, I speake to a mercifull King, that knowes how to passe by infirmities, and to pardon great offences: and so beseeching the Lord God of heaven and earth to blesse your Highnesse with many happy dayes, long to raigne over us to heare the Petitions of your faithfull Subjects, and to redresse their wronges, craving pardon for my boldnesse, I humbly take my leave. 
 Devoted to your Highnesse Service, IOHN SPENCER.
