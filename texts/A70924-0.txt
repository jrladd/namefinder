 
 TO
THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE
AND
most Illustrious Lord,
PHILIP Earle of  Pembroke  and
 Mongomery,  Baron Herbert of
 Cardiffe  and  Shurland, &c.  Lord
Chamberlaine of his  Majesties 
Household, Knight of
the Honourable Order of
the Garter; and one of his
 Maiesties  most Honourable
Privy
Counsell. 
 RIGHT HONOVRABLE, 
 I F  Books  were to be esteemed
for their  Bulke,  and
not for their  Worth: 
I would not presume to Dedicate
 
 so little a Book  as this is, to
 so great a Lord  as You are. But
since it is their  Goodnesse,  and not
their  Bignesse,  that makes them recommendable:
the  Book  it selfe,
I hope, shall answer for me. For  in
It,  your  Honour  shall finde  a great
deale  of good matter, contained in
 a little roome.  In It, You shall
see the Doctrine of the Church of
Rome  flatly condemned;  and
the Doctrine of the Reformed
Church,  fully Justified:  And that,
not by any passages taken out of the
 broken Cisternes  of the Traditions
of men; but by many expresse
Texts, and necessary Consequences
drawn out of the Pure Fountain of
 the very word of God.  In a word,
 
though it be of a contemptible Stature:
yet you shall finde It to be a
pretty tall Man of his hands; skilfull
in his weapons; and so full of
mettle and spirit, that like  a little
DAVID  (comeing in the name
of the Lord, and being armed with
his Word) he foyles and utterly
overthrowes that  Great GOLIAH
of Gath,  I meane the Church of
 Rome. 
 And now, most  Illustrious Lord, 
the thing that hath encouraged me
to make choice of  Your Honour, 
and seeke after  Your Patronage, 
is, that my  Author  (of Noble extraction
himselfe) Dedicated this
Book of his to  a Great and Religious
Princesse of my Nation, 
 
Daughter to that  Renowned
Prince,  the late  Duke of ROHAN: 
by which example, I thought
my selfe obliged not to disparage it
in  England. 
 But the most prevalent  Motive, 
and, as I may say, the very  Loadstone 
that hath attracted me thereunto,
is, chiefly, those transcendent
 vertues  which I see  shine  so brightly
in  Your Honor,  and wherewith
 God hath adorned Your Soule
as with a garment:  I meane that
 Fervent love  You have to the
 Truth:  That  Ardent Affection 
You shew to the  Sincerity  of  Religion: 
and that  Inbred and
Holy Hatred You beare,  not onely
to all  Popery  and  Superstition: 
 
but also to the  least thing 
that might conduce thereunto. 
 And for the Confirmation of
this testimony of mine: Give me
leave,  Most Noble Lord,  to
boast that I am very strong; and
may, with as much right as any
man, use in this the common English
Proverbe, that saith,  I come
with a Witnesse:  since I bring
 no lesse  with mee  than the
Voyce of the whole Kingdome. 
 For indeed,  Right Honorable, 
though I have been in most
places of  England,  and have
carefully and diligently observed
the bent and affections of the People:
I never yet met with any man
 
that dissented from that opinion. 
 What hopes then should not I
have that  Your Honor  will accept
of this poore Labour of mine,
and afford It  Your Protection, 
since It sutes so wel with  Your disposition; 
and that You shall see
in It the  Truth  of that  Religion 
which  You Professe;  and the  Falshood 
of that  Religion  which
 You Detest. 
 Vouchsafe therefore  Most Illustrious
Lord,  to receive It with a
gracious eye, and to afford It  Your
Countenance.  I know that for
 Your Honors  sake, it will be
welcome to  this Nation,  when
they see Your  Honorable Name 
in the front of It. And I make
 
no question but after they have
read It, they will love it also for
its owne sake. If in these times
(wherein many looke back towards
 Babylon  again, and Popery hath
been here so bold as to thinke
her selfe at home) the Publicke receive
any fruit thereby, they shall
be obliged unto  Your Honor  for
it: but I more especially, who
will acknowledge my selfe bound
so long as I live, to be and remaine, 
 Your Honours
most humble
and most devoted
Servant,
 J. MOVNTAINE.
