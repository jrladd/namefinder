 
 
 TO The Right Worshipfull, truly Worthy, and very much honoured Knight and Baronet, S t   Thomas Barrington,  and to his truely vertuous Lady, Grace, Mercy, and Peace from the Fountaine. 
 Right Worshipfull 
 M Any are those Relations that Christ the Prince of Peace stands in towards beleevers, He a Father, they his children, he a Sheapheard, they
 
his sheepe, he an head, they his members, he a King, they his Subjects, he a Lord, they his Servants, he a generall, they his Souldiers, he an husband, they his spouse; and amongst all these relations, not one enricheth the beleeving heart with more heavenly consolation than this, of being a husband to his Church, for by this the beleever becomes assured of all things his heart can desire, of Communion with Christ, of protection, preservation, maintenance, spirituall and temporall, yea of heaven it selfe Christs
 
spouses joynture: of this most comfortable subject I have published this small treatise, and the cause inforcing mee to the publication thereof, was the earnest request of some speciall and neere friends, whose affections were much moved with the Subject handled in the Pulpit: to satisfie their desire (being no lesse to me than a command) and for the comfort and Edification of Gods Church, I have endeavoured to publish the notes somewhat more fully handled than in the Pulpit, hoping that none
 
will despise  Timothie  for his Youth, considering that out of the mouth of Babes the praise of God is perfected. Although I want not some private respects to inforce me to dedicate this my labour unto your Worships, as that I may give some open testification of my gratefull minde to you both, for those personall favoure received, yet the chiefest reason was because this Treatise seemes to be due to you both, who are joyned together not onely in the common bonds of Matrimony, but as  Aquila  and
 
 Priscylla, Zacharie  and  Elizabeth  married together in the Lord and to the Lord Jesus, as to one Husband: this relation to Jesus Christ appeares by that high respect you shew to the spokesmen and faithfull ministers of Jesus Christ, by your Pietie and Zeale for the honour of the Lord Iesus. Let  Caesar  and  Pompey  contend for superiority in fading and vanishing greatnesse. Let your Worships contend with an holy ambition for the obtaining and retaining of Gods favour, and an humble acquaintance
 
and communion with his heavenly highnesse, by  keeping Faith and a pure Conscience. 
 Let the men of this world, whose sole portion is in this life, glory that they are crowned with a concurrance of present felicities. Let your Worships glory be, that together with a confluence of worldly contentments, the God of heaven hath crowned you with his Mercy and Grace in Christ, and esteeme it your chiefest Honour that God hath made you Honourable with the  Bereans  for
 
your love to the truth; with  Iabez  for your Piety and Devotion, and that he hath made you Noble with  Theophilus  for your love to God, his People, his Lawes, his Cause, which love of truth, piety, and devotion; love to God and his cause, shall give a luster to all your other greatnesse, and shall be able in the day of tryall and account, to make you stand like an unmoveable Rocke with triumphing confidence before the terrour of the last day, when all other worldly greatnes without the former shall
 
shrinke in the wetting, and shall wish it selfe so little it could not be seene; in that shall call to the Mountaines to fall upon it and to cover it. The great God of heaven and earth, replenish your Noble hearts with a dayly increase of heavenly hords of Grace, and treasures of Comforts in the practise of Holinesse, and perseverance in well doing, which may give you an earnest of those inexhaustable treasures of joy and happinesse, reserved in the highest heavens for
 
all that love the Lord Jesus in sincerity, this shall be the dayly prayer of him who humbly desires to bee accounted 
 Your Worships truest friend and servant for the good of your Soules: BENIAMIN KING.
