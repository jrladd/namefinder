 N Either (Right Honourable) are these borne out of time; for (as  Solomon saies,)  The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot:  and here is this Scripture verified in your
 
eyes. Here are good men celebrated, their vertnes powred out to participation; or, if this indeed has been no first, let it have acceptance yet as the latter raine: for so to pious remonstrances, there appertaines inculcation; and the  Penpateuch  of  Moses,  has, after an  Exodus,  a  Deuteronomium,  a  Lex repetita.  These, I say, issue not unseasonably; for thus have I found a way to correct and redeem some scattered imperfect Copies, and cleare my debt towards him, with whom I was long conversant, at the same hearth, the same boord, and in the same bedde. Thus a meanes of acknowledging my dependency, with your Lordships manifold extraordinary favours: and
 
thus by reprehending some others, have I (for the time to come) layd a forcible tie upon my owne behaviour. After which account given for the publishing, and Dedication, I rest, 
 Your Lordships most humble Servant,
 George Tooke.
