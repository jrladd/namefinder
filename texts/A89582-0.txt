 
 TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE  LORDS  and  COMMONS  Assembled in PARLIAMENT. 
 My Lords and Gentlemen, 
 I  Am not ignorant of the truth and weight of that speech of  Pliny, Aliud est scribere uni, aliud omnibus:  the same holds of Preaching, it's one thing to Preach a Sermon to a Congregation, another thing to Preach it to all the world in Print; especially upon such an occasion as this, and such a season as this, when the spirit of jealousie and mis-understanding is let loose, and mens
 
hearts as tinder ready to catch and kindle at every sparke; yet since you are pleased to conceive that this plaine Sermon may bee usefull to others, and thereupon to order my publication of it, I humbly obey your Order, desiring the Lords blessing to accompany it so farre as to make men wisely consider the wonderfull works of God, and returne to him the glory due unto his name; The same Lord watch over you, sanctifie you and guide all your consultations, that you may bee his blessed instrustruments to make this Land a quiet habitation for his people, and a place which himselfe may delight in: This is the daily prayer 
 Of your humble servant in the Lords work S. M.
