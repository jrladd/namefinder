 
 
 TO The Right Honourable the Lords and Commons in Parliament Assembled. 
 Right Honourable, 
 I  Have for many yeeres together professed my selfe a Souldier, and have been admitted by power flowing from your spring to act in command against the common Enemy, during these distracted times, which nothing more; desire then so to continue as farre as shall stand good with Gods Divine providence, and this causes continuance; therefore must crave leave to speake in such language as affectionate duty
 can best expresse it selfe by tongue: I confesse when I meditate upon the height of your noble spirits, and withall the flatnesse of my poore abilities; as I present this in love; so with much feare, as having medled with the publishing of such a Subject so unconcerning my own quality, although imboldned by divers friends to Publish this which I have kept secret for many yeeres together; but now at last reflecting upon the overture of things in these distracted times, am imboldened under your Honours favour to conceive the publishing of such a subject may conduce to the profitting of the Common-wealth. I am confident the Ancient establishment of the Crown Revenue Charge of this Kingdome of  England,  is not unknowne to most of your Honours in all the particulars; yet long time, and the face of war having ruined, distracted and desolated many of those Ancient particular establishments; few of them remaining within their bounds without some abuse; which by your great wisedomes, and pious care is now like to be re-established in all the particulars,
 as cannot in the first place but conduce to the good of the republike, and secondly to the good of all those who are or may be intressed herein; this then cannot hinder, but rather give light to so honourable a worke: I am for the Souldier, not for the Rhetorician, therefore left my endevours convert into a vapour, ere they can reach the height of your merits: I humbly crave your Honours to cherish them, desiring Almighty God to give your Honours a happy Issue in all your high concernments; so that you may attaine to that peace so much wished for by your Honours, and prayed for by him that is your devoted Souldier, now bound for the service in  Ireland,  to the losse of the uttermost drop of his blood to serve you, 
 Lazarus Haward.
