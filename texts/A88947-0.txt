 
 Reverend and Deare Sir, 
 T He right forme of Church Government being
more searched into of late time then formerly,
and your self amongst others having written for
the governing power, or jurisdiction of  Synods, 
over particular Churches: We therfore knowing our selves
bound as well as others, to try all things, and hold fast that
which is good, have considered as the Lord hath holpen us;
those Arguments of yours which are contained in your
Book, against the  Indepency of Churches;  and not being
satisfied therewith, your Book being published in Print; we
have therfore thought meet, in like fort to publish our Answer,
and in that way to shew unto your self and others,
what yet hinders us, that we do not think your Arguments
to be convincing. In which attempt we have bin the more
encouraged by your profession (which we dare not but believe)
that in what you have written, you have aimed at verity,
and not at victory; wherof we are the rather perswaded,
because we do perceive your whole discourse to be carried
along without passion and bitternesse, in a spirit of meeknesse
and love, which also we are willing to acknowledge before
all men, to your just commendation, and the glory of
that grace of God that gives you such an heart. And it is
our hope, that sith you professe to aim at the truth, and do
dispute with such a spirit, as if you meant so indeed; that
therfore it will not be unacceptable to you, if any weaknesse
be discovered in those grounds wheron you build this perswasion,
that in the present Question, the truth doth stand
on your side. And as your Book doth breathe forth a spirit
 
of meeknesse, ingenuity and love; so we hope you will find,
that we have aimed at the like in our Answer; which as
we have written and now published it for the truths sake;
and for the help of those that cannot attaine unto larger,
and more learned Treatises about this Subject; So in speciall
manner in love to your self, and our deare Country
men & friends, as in other places of  Lancashire,  so in your
Parish of  Winwick,  wherin one of us was born, and the
other was for sundry Years together an unworthy Minister
of the Gospel of Christ. Accept therfore we doe beseech
you, this brotherly labour of ours, which here we send you,
divided into these few  Chapters.  We are also willing upon
this occasion, to testifie our thankfullnes for that loving respect
which we found from you, when we lived together in
that Country; when you were pleased to own us in our sad
times. The Father of mercies be with you, and with all
those that love the truth in sincerity; and blesse that Reverend
and Grave  Assembly,  wherof we hear your self are a
Member, that by their wise and holy indeavours, the truth
may be cleared, and all corruptions removed in the Doctrine,
Worship, and Church Government in  ENGLAND, 
to his praise and glory; and the comfort of all those who unfainedly
desire that the Crowne of  Christ Iesus,  and the
Scepter of the Son of  God,  may be gloriously advanced over
all; which is the prayer of 
 Your Loving Brethren,
RICHARD MATHER,
and
WILLIAM TOMPSON.
