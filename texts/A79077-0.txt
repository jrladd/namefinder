 His Royall Maiesty, was graciously pleased to send a Message to the vpper house on Friday last being the next day after his Entertainment from  Scotland,  on which day he was expected by both houses, but his Royall Maiesty being otherwise disposed, deferd his going till some other time. 
 Yet neverthelesse out of his Royall disposition & clemency toward his subjects, he was graciously pleased to make the summe of his desires knowne to the houses of Parliament, wherfore he sent a Lord to the vpper house, to informe them that it was his Majesties Royall Pleasure, that the Traine bands should be dischargd, so great is his care of his Subiects and so gracious a consideration he had of the great care, cost, and dammage they sustaine, by reason of the long time that they had continued vnder command, and had attended on both houses. 
 His Maiesties pleasure was made knowne by the Lords to the house of Commons. 
 
 The house of Commons having received this message sent instantly to the Lords, desiring them to move his Majesty to condiscend to their requests so farre, as to give leave that the Traine Band might continue their service till such time as the affaires of the Kingdome were better setled. 
 Which was granted by the Lords, and a messenger immediately sent to the King being at his Royall Pallace at Hampton-court.
