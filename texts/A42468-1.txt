 
 TO The Right Honourable the LORDS and Commons of the High COURT OF PARLIAMENT. 
 ONE unknowne to the most of You, yet dayly praying for You all, that the God of Heaven, the alone giver of the best Counsell would sit with You, to guide and counsell You all, in all things for the present, and to come; As those great blessings through his blessing You have effected for Vs, already in suppressing the pride, the Idlenesse, and superstition of the Clergie, the destruction of the abominable & popish innovations, the annihilating of the great oppressing Courts of High Commission, and Star-Chamber;
 And that of honour which was greatly dishonoured, and above all that incomparable Act of the Triennial Parliament, a permanent benefit to Gods Church, for a ground and foundation of continuall Iustice and Religion, that reformation both of Magistrates and Ministery in ruling and teaching may be perfected, and such order and manner appointed for the peoples obedience, that unitie and concord in the truth may bee harmonious throughout this kingdome, And our gracious, King, with Your most honourable Assembly, and the whole Nation blessed; And because the best reformation, and perfect restitution are spirituall things; the one, the new making or re-begetting of mankind unto  God,  the other the inheritance or pur¦chased possession of Gods Children, called in Scriptures regeneration, and the perfection, and restitution, both which are the subject of my discourse, in my former Treatise Dedicated to Our dread Soveraigne, His Gracious Majestie. And in regard that life is hid for the present, and those truths are inward and spirituall, whose heavenly nature is not apprehended and understood by all Ministers, and I am certaine by fewer of the people: but they all for the most part looke for outward forme, and
 things exterior being such our selves for the greater number. 
 Right Honourable (the mistake of the Scriptures are so general in this particular in applying the testimony of the Holy Prophets, who generally speake and altogether agree in promising, and assuring the eternall heavenly and perfect estate to bee fulfilled and accomplished at the Resurrection, the Glorious comming of our Lord to judgment. Notwithstanding, such is the daily and continuall misprision of those precious promises to a worldly temporall and conceited estate here in this life by many severall factions; some of which, as in this, so in my former Treatise I have instanced) this mistaking, I say hath constrained me, and as I am perswaded in bounden dutie, I am obliged, to Dedicate and present in all humble submission this short Treatise unto Your Grave wisdomes, that by Your favourable countenance and respect to a thing so meane and from the hands of one meaner; My Brethren and fellow Citizens may come to see that Your prudent, and Honourable predecessors since the time of Reformation, from that mystery of iniquitie, and superstitious darkenesse of Anti-Christian Poperie, that
 GOD Almightie hath so assisted them by the ayde of the HOLY GHOST, that the Ministers Ordination, the time, place, the matter and manner prescribed for Gods publicke worship, (as is within this short Treatise briefely touched) is agreeable to GODS holy Word, for so farre as they have gone; And for the rest in a further and larger manner, Or for the better and more perfect ordering of what is already done, the LORD of Heaven direct the heart of Our Gracious KING with You His greatest and best Councell; And give unto You all the spirits of zeale, and feare of the LORD, so to Decree and Enact, that the Truth, the power and Sincerity of the Gospell may bee the honour and glory of this Kingdome, with the Ordinances of GOD in the purity thereof, all mis-understanding betweene His Royall MAIESTIE, and Your selves reconciled, and all evill Councellors on both sides removed, all dissentions, discords and disaffections amongst us people composed. And all of Vs againe, KING, Parliament and people, made one, as the Truth and Our GOD thereof is one. 
 Finally my humble prayer is that Your Wisdomes
 would pardon my boldnesse; And that You would be pleased to construe all that I have done or said to be enti ely and sincerely from the bottome of my heart, for the glory of GOD, the Honour of KING and Parliament, and the dutie of love I owe unto my Christian Neighbours in the fellowship and unitie of the Truth; And I shall ever remaine praying for you. 
 J. G.
