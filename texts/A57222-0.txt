 
 TO THE RIGHT VVORTHY AND NOBLY DISPOSED THOMAS SOAME Esquire, Alderman, and one of the Burgesses of Parliament for the Honorable City of  LONDON. 
 Sir, 
 T Hough a  Sranger  to your  Person,  I am no Stranger in my thankefull  Heart  (to the All-glorious Majesty of Heaven) for such as you: You whose  knowne worth,  & inward  Candor,  nor frownes, nor Flatterie, could ever force from its true Goodnesse for the generall good. Monster Ingratitude cannot say I flatter; Witnesse this Cities approbation, unanimous consent, free choice of you that are, (the All-guiding hand of Heaven be praised) free
 from the aspersion, Spots and staines of this Worlds  Vicious  and  Ambitious  Greatnesse. Let it not then seeme strange, that I (incouraged by your  Noble Vertues ) have here made bold, (out of an honest heart) Right worthy Sir, unto your selfe to  Dedicate  this  Booke.  It is a knowne  Maxime  to approved Iudgements, that  Illicita non prohibere consensus erroris est,  which being the full scope of this my endeavour, intended only for the exaltation of  Vertue,  detestation of  Vice,  and like the  Sea-mans Compasse  to direct soules from the dangerous  Passage  indirect. The  Scylla  and  Charybdes  Shelfes and Rocks of this uncleane and most uncertaine Ocean of the World. This being my intent, (as caveats against sinne not to be cavilled against, but by guilty Persons.) Accept then (vertuous Sir) this my good will, take it from him, who (leaving you and yours, all your faire Actions and occasions present to the  All-pure God  which never leaves his) remaines 
 Ever devoted to your Worthy Virtues
NATHANAEL RICHARDS.
