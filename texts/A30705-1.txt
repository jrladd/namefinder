 
 TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE the LORDS and others of His MAIESTIES most Honourable  Privy Councell. 
 ACcording to Your Honours command wee have enquired and considered how the  Mines-Royall  were left to Master  Bushell  by the Lady  Middleton,  and doe in all humility declare, that the silver mines were not worth the working, untill Master  Bushell  at his great charge discovered Rich Ore in the adjacent mountaines, which in all likelihood will both increase the Bullion & by his way of working, in short time give his Majesty a true tryall what the invaluable riches of these His  Welsh  mountaines are: for whereas the Mines in these parts were formerly wrought by Pumpes, and so growing deepe were left drowned with water, M.  Bushell  cuts through the maine Rockes, at the lowest levell, to an hundred fathome perpendicular, according to the German manner of working, which though chargeable, yet certaine, having foure severall Addits which hee continueth driving day and night into foure severall mountaines, his industry also hath
 
outstript former times, for by melting the poore fusible Ore, with the Rich, he produceth a third part more of silver with the same charge: and for accommodating the workes with all materials fit for  Mines Royall,  he hath spared no cost about repairing the milles, hath also built in his Majesties Castle of  Aberystwith  a faire mint, hath contracted with merchants of our owne and other Nations to supply the peoples necessity with Corne and other provisions, and payeth the miners and carriers at the Scales, and doubteth not to make them able Pyoners, and fit souldiers to doe His Majesty and their Country service upon any assault of an enemy. All which we commend to Your Honourable consideration, praying, &c. 
 Your Lordships humbly to be commanded, 
 
 Joseph Hexsteter,  chiefe Steward of the Mines. 
 Samuel Reynish,  Assay Masters of the Mint. 
 Water Barkesby,  Assay Masters of the Mint. 
 Humphrey Owen,  Clarke of the Mines.
