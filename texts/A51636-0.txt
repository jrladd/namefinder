 O F this  Name  and  Nature  (worthy Gentlewoman,) many small  Books  and  Pamphlets  have heretofore beene published the most of which neverthelesse have instructed rather how to marre then make good Meate: but this (in
 credit of my knowledge, and strict observation in Travell) is experimentally such as it pretends to bee in the Title Page thereof. Whereof I can say bu  this, and this it will perform for the sayer, That it gives each Meat his right for the manner o  dressing; Each dish his due, fo  the order of serving: and both good proofe of my desire to please and profit in the publishing. So, referring it to you  worthy perusall, and my selfe to your favourable opinion, I eve  remaine. 
 London,   Iuly,  20 1630 
 Yours, no lesse humbl  then truly devote
