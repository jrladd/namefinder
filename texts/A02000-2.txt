The right illustrious
Lord, Goncales Argeto de
Molina, Provinciall, and grand
Iusticiar, for his Majesty, for the
holy brotherhood, of Andalusia:
Lord of the Townes, of Veros,
and Dagancuelo: and of the
Castle of Gildolid. Alderman
of Civill,
&c. 
 T He great and particular
friendship,
which  Antonio Gratian, 
my brother,
that is in Heaven,
Counsellour of his Majesty, and
Secretary to his royall person,
did finde with your Honour,
obliges mee, to acknowledge
 
it, and to accompt of it, as all
the good wits of this age doe:
behoulding in your Honour,
those testimonies, which you
have afforded us in Armes, Government,
and writings, of his
much vertue, great courage and
cleare understanding. For having
at thirteene yeares old,
begun to serve his Majesty in
the Warrs, and not forgetting
the exercise of learning, as we
may perceive by the pledges,
which  Spaine  enjoyes, and expects
from your Honours wisdome,
in the governing of the
holy brother-hood, of  Andaluzia: 
which your Honour takes
charge of: he hath shewed his
worth, so that in one yeere
wherein he served, by condemning
a great number to death
and the Gallies, he hath secured
this Province, which was so
wasted with robbers; And I am
confident the Divine, and humane
 
Majesty, will grant your
Honour, the reward which
such workes deserve, which my
 Galateo  did rightly consider, in
beseeching of your Honour, to
accept of it, with the same affection,
it is offered. Our Lord
preserve the right renouned
person, of your Honour, many
dayes, with as much increase
of wealth as is possible. From
 Madrid  the 10. of  Ianuary,  1582. 
 Much renowned Sir, 
 your servant Lucas Gratian
Dantisco, Kisses your
Honourable hands.
