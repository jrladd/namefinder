 HONORABLE; 
 H Owsoever the feare of God be not thought necessary to human Judges by men of the world, yet the Scripture doth much presse it,  Exod.  18.21. 2  Chron.  9.7. Yea, some Heathens have acknowledged the necessity of it, therefore amongst the Ancients the court of Judgement was neare the Temple, that so the reverence of their gods might bend the minds of
 Judges to Justice. And they report that in  Aethiopia,  the Judges sitting in their Court, leave twelve seats in the highest place empty, which (they say) are the Angels seats. Therefore  he was the unjust Iudge in the Parable, that did not feare God, nor respect man;  Such an one was  Agesilaus,  who wrote to a Captain for a prisoner in these words;  Release  Nicias  the prisoner without faile; for if he have not offended, in Iustice you are to dismisse him; but of he have hainously offended, and deserved punishment, then dismisse him for my sake.  Here he mingled private affections in publick administrations, which is very sinfull. Therefore that you may avoid such rocks, especially consider, that Argument of the Scripture,  It is the Iudgement of the Lord; Iudicium Dei est,  (saith a Schoolman)  ideo Iudex in tribus Deo debei conformari, in potestate, in bonitate, & in veritate; It is the Iudgement of the Lord;  therefore the Judge ought to resemble God, while he judgeth in power, in goodnesse, and in truth. All which if you doe, the Kingdome may be freed from guilt, truth and peace may kisse each other, and you deliver your own soules; Which is the earnest prayer of him who desires to serve you in the Lord; 
 ANTHONY BURGES.
