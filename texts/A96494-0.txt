ferat:)  Offering up a  Stone,  how Rough and vnpollish'd
soever, to the  Building  of this  Temple:  Which
 Stone,  if any man shall goe about to asperse with his  untemper'd
Morter,  not suffering it to be laid (as the stones in  Solomon's 
Temple were)  without Noyse;  Let him know, that
He, who has already sacrificed his whole  Fortunes,  (such as
they were,) and is ready with all Cheerfulnesse to lay down his
 Life,  will not be unwilling to Expose his  Name;  if hereby,
he may be made able, in the least measure to promote the Glory
of his God, and the Wellfare of his Brethren. 
 Sir,  This is That which I plead for in the Pulpit, though, I
confesse, with more Zeale, then Learning; and this is That
which you Fight for in the Field, with no lesse Courage then
Loyalty. I have the honour and happinesse to be a witnesse of
your Compassion towards your  Brethren,  and of your Zeale towards
God: And therefore, while I see  You  beare in one hand
a Sword, 1. Sam. 13. 20.   sharpned  in  Israel,  not  among the Philistims,  against
the Rebellious  Sheba;  and in t'other a Stone, hewen out
of the Spirituall  Rock,  for Sacrilegious  Achanâ–ª  I hope, this
 Your  known detestation of Rebellion and Sacriledge;  Your 
cleare and unbiac'd pursuit of Religion and Liberty; will encourage
that in Another, which  You  Practice  Your selfe. 
The confidence whereof invites Me to begge  Your  Protection
to this Sermon, and the Author of it, 
 SIR, 
 Your most observant, 
at Your Command, 
GEORGE WILDE.
