 
 
 TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL S r  EDWARD POWEL, Knight and Baronet, one of the Masters of his M ties  Court of Requests. 
 Noble Sir, 
 T Here is a double Tie upon my duty towards you, that bindes me to the largest acknowledgement that can bee exprest by my best abilities:
 
Your generall eminence both in Honour, and, the worthiest meanes to it, Desert (which duly chalenge the generall observance of all men) and your particular noble favours to me, that require from me a never sufficient gratitude. But as Presents derive their value as well from the esteeme of the Receiver,
 
as from their owne inherent qualities; so will you make this rich by your acceptance, that is without all worth as it is my poore Donative, though it containe in it selfe many secret and mysticall vertues, being an Enchiridion of many rare subjects, both Morall and Divine, fit for the most serious
 
observation and meditation: The industry of many excellently-learned Authors, whose severall Papers were most accidentally committed to me, to be their fortunate, though unworthy, preserver and Publisher. The only end for which I beg your Noble disposition to entertaine it, is that it may be understood a testimony
 
of his due thankfulnesse, whose only ambition is to be knowne and stiled, 
 The humblest of your servants. R. H.
