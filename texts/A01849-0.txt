 
 
 To the truely Noble,
and much honored,
S r.  ROBERT ANSTRUTHER
Knight, and one of the
 Gentleman of his Majesties
Privy Chamber. 
 SIR, 
 I T is a position, and
maine Tenent agreed
upon by the most judicious,
that to attaine unto  Honour,
Wisedome  is the truly Polestarre,
and to retaine it,  Vertue 
the sole  Patronesse:  It being  non 
 
 ad tempus Invitamentum, sed perpetuae
virtutis premium.  To
which, though some have arrived
by  favour,  others by  fortune, 
yet it may be ingeniously confest
of You, that by Your owne
 merit  You have won to this  meridian: 
Into which the sacred
Majesty of Great  Brittaine  having
a true inspection, out of
many others, hee made select
choise of you, (for your known
abilities) to create his Lord  Embassadour 
to the Majesty of the
Empire. And during your abode
at  Vienna  in  Austria,  where
the Emperors Court was then
kept, the Gentleman, Author
 
hereof, Mr.  Richard Hurst  (now
deceased) your (then) servant
and Secretary, at his more spare
and retired houres, made this
his Worke his play, and in his
most solitude his best solace.
And unto whose  Patronage  may
it more properly appertaine,
than to your Noble selfe, being
writ in your forraigne service.
This was the maine inducement,
which not onely incouraged,
but imboldned me to
this presentment, knowing that
 Honos alit Artes;  and the rather
presuming on your acceptance
hereof, since they who in their
life time the  Muses  most favour,
 
those, after life, the nine
 Sisters  most honour. Thus,
with pardon for my boldnesse
crav'd, I humbly take
my leave of You. 
 Yours in all
Observance,
S. B.
