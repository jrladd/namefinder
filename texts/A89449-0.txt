 
 
 To the right Honourable  EDWARD,  Earle of  Dorset,  Lord  Buckhurst,  Knight of the most Honourable Order of the Garter, Lord Chamberberlaine of his Majesties Houshold, and one of his Honourable Privie Councell. 
 SIR, 
 I  Have presumed to present this Translation to your Lordships view, and send it into the world under your Patronage. And though my selfe bee not worthy so great a Patron, yet the Author Count  Virgilio Maluezzi  his Workes generally are of such esteem, that a Noble and honourable Penne in this Kingdome hath vouchsafed to English some part of
 them. And this particular Historie is so inter-woven with severall grave politick Discourses, learned and pithy Speeches upon sundry occasions, that I question not but your Lordship may find somewhat in it worthy your reading at vacant houres. This, and your ever knowne love to learning, shewed by your daily favours continually flowing upon Scholars, hath encouraged mee to prefix your honoured Name to these my endeavours: in which though I come farre short of  Maluezzi 's incomparable stile, or the honourable Translators facunditie, I shall most humbly beseech your honour to cast a gracious aspect upon it, which may encourage mee to attempt higher things, if so great a one shall deigne to accept of this so small present. So praying God ever to blesse you, & all your honorable family, I humbly rest, 
 Your Honours most devoted and humble servant,  Robert Gentilis.
