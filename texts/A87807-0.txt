 SIRS, 
 THough Rebels seem to have so much Law and Logick, that none but  argumentum Bacillinum,  Club-law, will ever non-plus them, yet as the Pulpit and Presse have both helped to heighten this Rebellion, so it is fit they should both endeavour the de-throning of it. I know that Apologies are as much in use as Printing, but let no such complements henceforth come to the presse, seeing such leane unpolished notions as these have been perswaded thither. And indeed, should truth & loyalty have no better Advocates then my selfe, Heresie and Rebellion might well hope to bee perpetuall. But I know there are many thousands ready
 to make up my defects; and truly that tongue deserveth to be cut out, that hand to bee cut off, that will not now bee lifted up in His Majesties behalf, whose captivitie every loyall subject should account his owne, remembring him that is in bonds, as bound with him, no friend of his having any hope of liberty, till Hee can lead him to it; and heavens hasten that happy day. This is the bounden daily prayer of 
 Your friend and servant,  P. K.
