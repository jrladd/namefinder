 Hereford,  Baron  Ferrars  of  Chartley,  Lord
 Bourcheir  and  Lovaine,  One of His Majesties most Honourable Privy Councell, and Generall of the Army raised by the Parliament, in Defence of the true Protestant Religion, his Majesties Person, the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdome, and the Priviledges of
 Parliament. 
 Right Honourable, 
 G Reatnesse and Goodnesse as they are infinitely in GOD, so in what degree they concentre in Man, they have a God like Divine influence and power to create Love, and Respect Boldnesse and Reverence in Persons Inferior; Your goodnesse hath made you Great, and your Greatnes (contrary to common Experience) hath made you Good; and both these hath emboldened me humbly to solicite your  Excellence,  that this small  Snapsacke,  upon the strictest search of your dilligent Sentinels, and approbation thereof, may freely passe among your Common Souldiers: It is not my presumption to present your  Excellence,  with the broken Morsells Cram'd up therein, knowing that Curious
 Carving fit for such a personage, becomes not a  Snap sacke;  and well Considering, both your plentifull Supply from your Spirituall Quartermasters, and mine owne insufficiency, being neither a Prophet, nor a Prophets Sonne: but the best of my hopes, is your
 EXCELLENCIES  permission of its free Portage; and could it procure the light of your countenance, and your Command of it's use as a taken hereof it would be to its Author like the  filling of the poore Widdowes Vess lls for the Oyle in the Cruce, a greater  reward, then ever
 s look't for: howsoever, the Eternall God, and our succeeding Posterity shall call you blessed for your Love, Zeale, and Courage, in Gods and your Countries Cause: And that the Almighty may not onely make you a  Moses, to lead his  Israel
 out of  Egypt,  and bring you to Mount  Nebo  in the sight of the good Land;  But a  Ioshuah  to bring them into the Possession thereof, removing all Obstacles, supplying all wants, in your way; fill you withall the divine qualifications of the worthies of Israel;  make you Strong and of good Courage, bee with you, never leave you nor forsake you,  is the earnest Prayer, as of many thousands the Israelites of GOD, so amongst them, of your  EXCELLENCIES  most humbly Devoted, Vnworthy, whose Name should be Spel'd out, 
 J. P.
