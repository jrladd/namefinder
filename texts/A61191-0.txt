 
 
 To the Honourable,  VVilliam Lenthal,   Esq  Speaker of the Honourable House of COMMONS. 
 SIR, 
 I F my own  Genius  had not prompted me, the Nature of this  Discourse  would have led me to You; being of the Actions of that ARMY, which (as it received the compleat actuation of its Form, by the concurrence of the Right honourable the House of PEERES; so it) received its first rise from that Honourable House where you sit, and have sate as  Speaker,  (after an unparallel'd instance) for sixe continued Years together; deriving in the mean time, not so much  wonder,  as  benefit  to the Kingdome thereby: having, all along, by the same
  Publique  Organ  asserted the  English freedome,  whereby once (since the beginning of this Parliament) You answered  His Majesty,  (who had then after an unusual manner entred your House:)  That you had neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, but what that Honourable House gave you.  In all the warm Influences and Motions whereby this  Army  hath been cherished, You have been One in the  Constellation,  yea, a chief and leading One. 
 SIR, I mention not these things to lay a  stumbling-block  of Pride before you; But to minde you of that which I know you acknowledge, That  One  greater then  States,  gave you this faithfulnesse. Now as for this Story Sir, what is wanting in it of  Elegancie  of Phrase, hath been endeavoured to be supplied in the  truth  of the Relation: And next to that, a good proportion of my care hath been to carry it without such  distatefull reflection,  as might render it unfit for your  Candor  to patronize; I make no question but you will easily discern a thread of  Divinity  running through the whole proceeding of this Army, and that their Actions have been nothing else, but a  Copy  of the  Wisdom, Power, Providence,  and  love  of  God  put forth in men. 
 My Prayers for you, and the Honourable Senate are,  That God who hath made all your Enemies without, appear but flesh, and that flesh grasse,
  would save you from the power of flesh within, that you may act all things in the strength and excellency of that Spirit that hath wrought these things for ye, that ye may be partakers of as much of God as of Victory;  whereby ye shall be sure, not only to  arrive  your selves  laden  with  Honour,  and all the sweet  fruits  of your  unwearied Labours  at the  Port  of  glory,  but shall also  direct  the  tossed Bark  of this  Common-wealth  towards the  Haven  of  Rest  and  Righteousnesse. 
 SIR, In your  publike merit  many thousands are no lesse then I am, who am professedly, 
 Sir, 
 Your most humble Servant,  I
