 
 TO THE RIGHT Honourable Lady, G. O. C. K. 
 MADAM, 
 I  Never had the happinesse personally to see, or present my service to your Honour, yet so much have I heard of your vertue, specially this of Patience, that I presume, amongst all the Ladies of this Kingdome to choose you sole Patronesse of this School of Patience; of which booke
 
the famous  Drexelius  may well chalenge himself Authour, I nought else but the errours. In this Scool, Madam, all we mortals, from the highest to the lowest, must of necessity be Scholars; not to suffer, were not to live. Then, as the kid in the fable breaking from the altar, when its fellows were sacrificed, and falling afterward amongst a heard of wolves cried out; why not rather to the Gods? So we Christians, sith suffer needs we must, why not rather for God, for him who suffered first for us, then for him who goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour? If patiently and willingly we suffer, the labour's
 
lesse, the reward greater; if unpatiently and unwillingly, the labour more, the reward none at all, but contrariwise eternall punishment. All the art then and mastery is, not to be too dissolute in prosperity, nor diffident, or impatient in adversity; this skill is learnd by Patience, the precepts and rules whereof this booke declares; which would not presume to shew it self in publike, without the honour of your Ladiships protection; To whom I likewise recommend the most dutifull respects of 
 Your Honours most humble servant R. S.
