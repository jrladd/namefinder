 Right Honourable, 
 T He Heath n by the purblind light of nature were so gratefull, that they did Deifie their Patrons, as the Historian telleth us: a shame it were for Christians, nay for Divines in the meridian sunshine of the Gospell, not to acknowledge their Benefactors: to vindicate my selfe from such aspersion, I presume humbly to dedicate this paper present, to your Lordship in all thankfull acknowledgment of your bounteous favours: 
 Thou art troubled much and carefull for many
 things, but one thing is necessary,  saith our blessed. Saviour to  Martha  in the Gospell. 
 For though at your returne from forraigne parts, Your Lordship finds Your native Country miserably embroyled in a civill warre, which is a sea of all infaelicity, and therefore the authors thereof deserve to be banished out of the borders of humane nature as that learned Frenchman observeth.
 Charron of wisedome, lib.     cap.  11. .  Yet my good Lord in the middest of all these distractions, I hope you wil never forget that  unum necessarium;  You have a God to serve, a soule to save That this may be Your Lordships prime care and intention , and that in these tottering times, wherein the very foundations of the earth are out of course, you may be preserved by the power of God, through faith unto salvation, in his appointed time, exchanging your Coronet of temporary honour for that Crowne of immortall, immaculate, and immarcessible glory, is the continued prayer of 
 Your Lordships most humbly devoted Chaplaine and servant,  THOM. TVVITTEE.
