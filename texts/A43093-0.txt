 Honourable Gentlemen, 
 T HE noble favours I daily receive from you, since my arrivall out of  Ireland,  into this County, hath imboldned me to offer this poor tribute of mine experience, not to teach your uncontrollable knowledges, but humbly desire it may kisse your hands, as a sacrifice offered from your servant, or as a weaknesse that stands in need of your protections. In your Honours  I  know is power to judge of my labour, and in you also is power to exercise mercy;  I  hope  I  have written nothing that is erring from sence or truth: having not laboured mine own, but the profit of my poore bleeding, dying Country-men, whom these miserable times have called out to this miserable unnaturall War: desiring not only his temporall victory, (but above al) his spirituall. There may be many puny Scholars that from these briefe Rules, may gather more abler judgements: Your noble favours and allowance can only make it acceptable to those which need it, especially in this Country, which I wish to be served by it: then let those graces fly from your noble natures, that as now  I  live,  I  may die your Honours poore 
 Servant and Soldier  L. H.
