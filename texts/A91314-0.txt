 Most meritoriously Honourable, 
 T HE many late  Glorious Trophies  and  Vnparalel'd Successes,  wherewith the  Lord of Hosts  hath been graciously pleased to  Crowne  Your  cordiall Military Vndertakings,  to the  Admiration  of all Your  Friends,  the  Astonishment, Confusion  of all the  publike Malignant Enemies  of  Our Churches,  Kingdomes  Tranquility;  as they have engaged the  Parliament,  (with all parts of the  Realme  under their Command) to return publike  Solemn Prayses  unto  God,  for sundry  Successive Victories,  over puissant Armies in the  Field,  and  Conquests  of divers  Strong-holds,  atcheived by Your  indefatigable Industry, Incomparable valour,  through  Gods blessing  on them: so it hath specially obliged Me, as to render  particular Thankesgiving  unto God, so to tender some  small apparent Monument  of my  Obligations  and  Gratitude  to  Your selfe,  whom God hath  highly honoured  to all posterity, in making You an happy Instrument of redeeming my  Native Country (Sommersetshire)  with the adjacent Counties, out of the  devouring Jawes  of the  oppressing Enemy,  and of reviving, recovering our  lost dying Kingdome  even at its lowest Ebbe, in a time of greatest need, with so great
 
Celerity, so little effusion of  English Blood  on either side; Which I knew not, for the present, how more visibly to expresse, then by presenting  Your Honour  with this briefe  P lemicall Ʋindication,  in defect of a  Richer Present. 
 It was my great  undemerited Happinesse,  and your  Generous Humility  (at Your first arivall in  London  from the  North,  to undertake the  Chiefe Command  of the  Parliaments Forces)  to stoop so far below Your selfe, as to honour Me with Your  voluntary sweet Acquaintance  and  Discourse;  which emboldens me to crave this  further Favour,  to dignifie this rude  Ʋindication,  with your  Noble Acceptation,  of so  Small unpolished a Piece;  whose Subject matter  (Church Discipline)  is of so  Great concernment,  that the  Settlement  thereof according to  Gods Word,  and the  Purest times▪  is one principle end of Your and Our taking up  Defensive Armes. 
 I shall not be so injurious to the  State  or  You,  to interrupt Your weighty  Military Affaires,  or retard Your  Admirable Expeditions  with my  unseasonable Lines.  I shall rather become a  dayly Orator  to the  Lord of Hosts,  so far to multiply the  weekely Catalogues  of Your  sucessefull Conquests,  that You may ere long return to the  Great Counsell  and  Metropolis  of our  Realme  in a  Triumphant Chariot,  with this  Honourable victorious Motto,  engraven in  golden Characters  on Your  Helmet; This is the Generall whom the Lord hath honoured to be, next under him, The speedy Finisher of our long protracted Civil Wars; And happy Restorer of our Long-desired Peace:  Which is and shall be the  Prayer  of 
 Your Honours most Devoted Friend and Servant WILLIAM PRYNNE.
