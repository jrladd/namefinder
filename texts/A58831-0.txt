 
 TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM EARLE OF  BEDFORD,  and his Honourable friends Adventurers in the great levell of  FENNES. 
 Right Honourable, 
 I F I should now be silent, I should not know how to frame my self an excuse: Having heretofore beene a servant to the Right Honourable, the Earle of  Bedford,  & his Honorable friends in the drayning: And well observing how one Mr  Hill  who had then power put into his hands, did begin to go a wrong way to work upon  Wisbeech  River; which so soone as I perceived, I made it knowne, and although
 some money was expended that way by him before I could prevent it, yet I saved them a  1000.  pounds; And can I now be silent? when by speaking I may not onely save  1000.  but many thousands, in preventing the pursuance of a desperate dessgne, which the Honorable Committee for the Fens have ordered to be printed, that whosoever it concernes might make exceptions against it; silence in this case might give the Parliament and your Lordships just cause to approve thereof, which promise so faire, and to which none could take exceptions, though invited to it. I have therefore with all faithfulnesse, briefly laid open the danger, which in all humility I present unto your Lordships, that the danger being discovered, which before lay hid under faire promises and prete  may be avoided: And now whether these my   may here prove acceptable or no, I know not; Yet however, I have declared my opinion, and left it extant, that future times may witnesse that the danger was discovered. For my owne part I am confident, that if this designe be pursued, what I have now written, one day by costly experience will be found to be true. 
 Yours Honours to serve to his utmost,  Edmund Scotten.
