 SIR, 
 A Ccording to my promise I have transcribed Master  Philpots  Letter for baptizing infants; to which I have added the universall, and continued practice of the Church of God, from the Apostles time hitherto; together with the judgement of the most learned, orthodox, and godly Divines, both ancient and moderne: which may serve as a cloud of witnesses to prove, that infants of Christians, not onely may, but ought to be baptized. I am confident, that these collections (with the blessing of God) will give full satisfaction to any that are not fore-stalled with wilfulnesse in their owne opinion. For if Venerable Antiquity, Æ²niversall Practice, un-interrupted Custome, Harmony of Churches, strength of Argument, and the Authority of sacred Scripture be of any force, then doubtlesse we have sufficient warrant for admitting the children of believing parents to this Ordinance of baptisme. The testimonies I have here produced, lie scattered up and downe in severall Authors, I sum them up together in this little Treatise; which I strove to make little, because, little bookes do most good, or most harme, being every mans purchase, and soon read over. My Apologie for troubling you with a businesse of this nature, is onely this, that I am 
 Your humble servant in the Lord, ROBERT RAM.
