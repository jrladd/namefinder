 
 
 TO THE Right Honourable ROBERT Earle of  VVarwick,  Baron of  Lees,  one of his Majesties most Honourable Privie Councell. 
 My very honourable Lord, 
 T He many noble favours which I have received from your Lordship chiefly, and from others of your noble Family, compell mee (since these Sermons will needs be publike, beyond my intentions) to adde to them the honour of your Lordships name; and to set upon them this Seal of Gratitude, from a heart that unfainedly prayes for all those encreases to your Lordship and yours, which may make both your Lordship and them truly honourable in this,
 
and ever happy in the other world: For so I must professe to all the world, your Noblenesse hath abundantly deserved of your Lordships most humble, and obliged Servant, 
 IOHN GAUDEN.
