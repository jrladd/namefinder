 SIR, 
 P Art of these Papers being already destin'd to your Highnesses Recreation, the  rest  (like divided Wormes) by reuniting to their  peeces,  are link't againe into an  entire-nothing.  All I pretend to here exceeds not the  Pedlers  Ambition, who in the strength of his  Portable VVarehouse,  swells into the title of a  Merchant,  and yet instead of  Silkes  and  Tissues,  receives them with nothing but  Tapes,  and Filletings. The Vessell is here so  unfraught  and  Empty,  that it aimes at so  Royall a Haven,  not by designe of  Commerce,  or  Trading,  but  shelter,  and  safety  from  tempestuous Censures,  which is the greatest Ambiton of your Highnesse's 
 Most humble servant M. LL.
