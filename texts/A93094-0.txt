 Right Honourable, 
 Y Ou whose names are graven so deeply on the Bedrole of  Fame,  that the rust of all devouring time, shall never be able to eat or diminists a Letter;  Adulation,  and my nature are ods, and I have the least to answer for that, of all my Crimes; yet it becomes the just to be thankfull,  and those that will not honour the Instruments of Gods Glory, detract from their Maker.  First, therefore all thankes be rendred to your honours for your constant fidelity to your Country, that you would not degenerate, but choose rather to be afflicted with Gods people, then to injoy the pleasures of sinne for aseason, that you would be pleased to under goe Callumnies, and the  Traytors.   Brand  of  infamie;  the subjects of this Kingdome cannot chuse but mutually joyne with me, as once the women in the dance, andsay,  many Peeres have done
  worthy deeds for the good of the people, but ye have exceeded them all,  undergoing the frowne of Majestie, which who so lookes on sees a Basilisk, and seldome escapeth Death; venturing your Estates, wherein some men place their  Summum Bonum,  and many of you your lives to purchase Freedome for a people, altogether ungratefull (I say not so) but some men furnisht with corrupted mindes, whom satan hath filled with the spirit of  Enmitie,  and  Detraction,  to the griefe of my soule, and of all the least vertuous, with their pennes, like so many sharpened Pikes, as  Saul,  once to  David  his Preserver, they stab at their deliverers: men that are as unconstant as the wind, more foolish then  Claudius,  more wicked then  Stajus,  who place their felicity in that to be avoyded City-racer  Mutabilitie,  some of whose seurrilous Emptie Pamphlets, coming to my hands, I conceived I was bound in honour to my Maker, and in thankfulnesse to your Honours, to Reply to the said Pamphlets;  for these ravenous Fowles the People, are naturally inclined, with greedinesse to swallow whole Gobbets of such carion, though they surfet themselves thereby, and are often forced for it, to be let bloud.  Thus desiring that great God, who hath greatly assisted your Honours hithereto, to keepe you for ever untouched by your Enemies, I cease, and shall ever remaine, 
 Your Honours most humble Servant. S. S.
