 My Lord, 
 T His Sermon being delivered by a son of mine, whom it hath pleased God to call to his speciall service in the Ministery of his Gospel, upon the anniversary day of the Inauguration of our gracious Soveraigne, the  27  of  March  last. In the passing of it, not only thorough my eares (for I may well be deemed partiall) but of diverse others of the then Auditors (who surely could not be partiall) it found such approbation, as wee did not thinke fit it should be confined within those narrow limits of a small Parish but that it should bee communicated to others, by this diffusive way of silent speaking by these dumb Characters, to the
 
eyes, eares and hearts of all who please. My Lord, I have long studied to find out some way or other, wherely I might returne some acknowledgement of those many undeserved favours, which I have received from your Lordship, and having the free tender of this Sermon, from the Deliverer of it as a pledge of his duty to mee: I could not but think fit (I having nothing else so worthy) to present it to your Lordship, the rather; First because the subject of it is touching Rulers and Magistrates, amongst which your Lordship sits in none of the lowest rankes. Secondly, because it teacheth the duty of the people to their Rulers and Magistrates, and how they ought to deport themselves towards them in words and actions. A thing very necessary in this licencious age of ours where every man conceives hee may not only thinke what hee list, but utter what he thinkes, be it of the greatest or highest: I shall humbly desire your Lordship, to set apart one vacant houre for the perusall of it, and consider it comes from a higher Spirit than from the spirit of the Speaker; Wherefore it cannot bee altogether unworthy Your Lordships sparing so much time for contemplation of it: We shall wish it may prove acceptable to Your Lordship; And for us, both the  Author  and the  Presenter, 
 
Wee shall ever (as exceedingly obliged) rest desirous to take hold of all occasions to offer to Your Lordship all fit testimonies of our duties and respects and shall ever remaine 
 Your Lordships most humble and affectionate servants in all we can performe, NATHANIEL HALL, WILLIAM HALL.
