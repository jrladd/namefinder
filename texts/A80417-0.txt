 
 The Epistle Dedicatory to His Excellence the Earle of ESSEX. 
 M Ay it please Your Excellence, to accept the affectionated tender of your humble servant, for why your Noble and Iuditious Honor hath still been held a Patron of the Muses, a Lover of Arts, and Artlike Siences, and all good Arts ingenious man attaines to; Let not me then dispaire, though the first dip of my weak forward Pen ascend unto so high a Dedication, I gently crave it might not meet refection, because it is my love, if so, it would quite kill my hopes prepared journey, and that sacred Mount I now am labouring up, fall from't, and perish, and made a scorne unto the Lawrell tree, in my desire to touch it, but noble Nature mixt with gentill Spirits, ascends like Mirrh unto the saving Heavens, and gives the same desire to you on earth, from whose favours warmth, I hope my spring flourish, and these few mixt Poems here in Prose and Verse, he mildly sensured; and my obedient Service, with my love thought free from flattery, to whose Noble and Iuditeous sensure I recommend them unto Your Excellencies view. 
 And desire to be found,  Your Excellencies most humble  Servant,  William Cooke.
