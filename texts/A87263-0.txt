 Brethren, 
 B E loved in the bloud of  JESUS:  for preaching obedience to God and the King: I am, and have beene more then a mouth a prisoner, and cannot get my liberty, unlesse I would promise to forbeare preaching to you, as I have done, and yet I have promised to preach nothing to you, but what I shall prove plainely from the word of God, the doctrine of the Church of  England,  the oath of Supremacy, the oath of Allegiance, and our late Protestation; all which I have published for your satisfaction: If you will read those oaths, and these Sermons in my absence; you shall find that I have dealt faithfully with you; and am ready to seale my doctrine. with my dearest bloudâ–ª if God shall call so great a sinner to so great an honour. Neither Living, nor Liberty, nor Life is precious to mee, when I should sacrifice them all to the glory of my great good God, the service of my gracious Soveraigne, and the discharge of a good conscience towards my selfe and you: I told you before how sensible I was of danger for this my fidelity, but for Zions sake I could not, I cannot hold my peace, God will imprison mee to Hell,
 if I imprison his truths,  Feare God, Honour the King,  is both Law and Gospell; and my prayer is, that you all may live and dye good Christians, and good Subjects: and as the Church prayed for Saint  Peter  in prison, so doe you for 
 your affectionate Pastour, in prison for his God, his King, his Conscience, regulated by the word of God, the Doctrine of the Church of ENGLAND, and his Oaths. G. I. 
 Decemb.  3. 1642.
