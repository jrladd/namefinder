 Most Honorable  LORDS,  And ye most Noble  KNIGHTS, CITIZENS,  and  BURGESSES  of the House of COMMONS: 
 N Othing could fall out more happily to me, then that my bold Adversaries have appealed to your inviolable Justice; for sure I am, whiles you are (as you ever wilbe) your selves, wise, and just, my cause cannot miscarry in your hands. With no lesse, therfore, but better grounded confidence, I cast my self upon your unpartiall judgement; rejoycing to think, how clearly you will distinguish betwixt a facing boldnesse, and a modest Evidence of truth: How can I but receive
 
courage from your pious, and just proceedings? It is I that vindicate, these men oppose that holy Leiturgy, which your most religious Order in this Active session commanded to be intirely observed. How busie Faction is to crosse that your most seasonable Decree, every day yeelds new and lamentable proofs. If these indeavours of mine serve onely for the pursuance of your so necessary, and gracious Act; they cannot fear to be unwelcome. But, if I have hurt a good cause, by a weak and insufficient handling, let me suffer in your censure, and let my Adversaries triumph in my sufferings. Contrarily, if after all their smooth insinuations, it shall be found, that this champertous combination hath gone about, by meer shews of proof, to feed the unquiet humors of men, in the unjust dislike of most justifiable, ancient, and sacred Institutions, and to cast false blames upon my peaceable and sincere managings of a certain Truth, let them passe for what they are, and feel that justice which they have appealed.
