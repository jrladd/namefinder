 
 
 TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE WILLIAM FENIS, Viscount  Say  and  Sele,  Master of the Court of  Wards and Liveries, and one of his Majesties most Honourable privie Councell. 
 S O great is the unhappinesse of our times, right Honourable, wherein men
 have been rather led by affection, than judgement, that a bare  ipse dixit  hath with most men casily gained the authoritie of a truth. Hereby able wits have been discouraged, Arts have lost much lustre, and the World more light. 
 This ensuing Treatise, being a poore Orphant, that it might be secured from such prejudice, the Epidemical distemper of our times, I thought best humbly to shrowd under your Honours protection, to the intent also
 that they who will not receive a naked truth for it selfe, may embrace it for the beauty it shall derive from so noble a Patron. Vouchsafe then, Right Honourable, as to accept it, together with this my humble and thankfull acknowledgement (the best coine I have) of all your favours toward my selfe & stock whence I sprang: so to pardon my boldnesse in interrupting you. 
 The God of the spirits of all flesh, blesse your Lordship, your honourable
 Lady, & hopefull of-spring, in the fatnesse of the earth, and dew of heaven, and after lead you to that place where the spirits of just men made perfect, take sanctuary, which shall be, the daily prayer of 
 Your Honours in all humility to be commanded, ELIAS PALMER.
