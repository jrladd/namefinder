 RIGHT HONORABLE, 
 A Ccording to the Fame we have heard of you, so have we found in you, a spirit of tendernesse and compassion towards the oppressed, which ever springs from the courage and fortitude of a heart resolute to suppresse the Oppressor, be his power and policie what it may, whilst men unsensible of the cause of the Needy, ever stand in readinesse to side with the strongest partie, and so (as occasion serves) to become one with the cruell, venting the same spirit, which for advantage can easily transform it selfe, so as if
 
power comply with the just mans cause, the vizard of hypocrisie is soon put on by such, either to become dumb & silent, or else to speak so, as may best advantage it selfe, let the cause be what it will. Your wisdom and noble care in those weighty affairs committed to your trust, commands and binds us over to make a more particular and full relation (then formerly we have done) of what hath passed betwixt some other Colonies in NEVV-ENGLAND, and our selves; that if it be possible to find any leisure hours in a crowd of so great imployments, your Honours might be pleased to take a more full view of things; in the mean time we stand humbly ingaged, as we have done; and ever shall in any service, that what we are, or have, can tender to the honour and peace of our Native Countrey, or to any truehearted well-Wisher thereof; and if no other service (we can) may be acceptable, yet of this imployment none shall prevent us (whilst our God gives us hearts) daily to pray for you. 
 Your Honours most humble Servants, the Inhabitants of  Shaw-omet,  whose names are often expressed in this Narration.
