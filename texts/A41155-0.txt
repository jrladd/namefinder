 
 
 TO THE RIGHT
Honourable  Algernon  Earle of
 Northumberland,  Lord  Percy, Lucy, Poynings,
Fitzpaine, Brian  and  Latimer,  Lord High Admirall
of  England,  Knight of the most Noble order of
the Garter, and one of his Majesties
most Honourable Privie
Councell. 
 Right Honourable, 
 T He unworthy oppressed Author
hath not long since
groaned under the severe
censure of the late high
Commission for the ensuing
speculations, which
now he adventures to present unto your Honour,
hoping for a candid acceptance, and interpretation
of his poore endeavours for the
good of  Zion.  Had not the rising Sunne of
an auspicious Parliament dispelled those
 
clouds of oppression and tyrannie, that menaced
a drowning both to me and them, they
had beene choaked in their embryo, and never
enjoyed the happinesse they have now attained
in your honourable aspect. Pardon
(most noble Lord) the enforced presumption
of the distressed Author, which implores
and hopes for your Honourable Patronage,
and humbly praying for the daily increase of
your Honours health and eternall happinesse,
remaines 
 Your Honours most humble
most devoted servant, 
William Fenwick.
