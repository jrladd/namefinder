 Fellow souldiers and friends: 
 T O the two former Treatises of Gods promises of good things to us, and of our Vowes of obedience to him, which by his alone help I have published; I adde these few fragments following, and
 because I will be as little tedious as I can, I shall only commend them to your carefull consideration, observation and practice, as you may find them agreeable to sound doctrine and good manners, and usefull to your occasions, and them and you to the especiall blessing of our God in the Lord Jesus.
