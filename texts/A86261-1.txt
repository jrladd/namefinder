 Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull, 
 Y Our  constant  Favours which I  alwayes  find, 
 Do me in all my best endeavours bind, 
 Upon all fair occasions, to expresse 
 My  due  and  deeply  bounden thankfullnesse, 
 
Aswell for  past  as  present  sweet-Supplies, 
 Which from your  blessed-House  of Charities 
 Poore  Orphant-cheering-brests,  my- Self  have found, 
 With  Thousands-more,  whom (else) distresse had drown'd 
 In over flowing  floods  of  Poverty, 
 Our  Parents  poor being forc't from us to fly, 
 And leave us  hopelesse  Imps, in  helplesse  age 
 To all Earths woes, fully, on us to rage. 
 These,  these  (I say) indissoluble  Tyes 
 Of  ancient  and of  modern  Courtesies, 
 Which to Heavens glory, here, memorate, 
 Doe me (blest Patrons) stirre and stimulate, 
 To  dedicate  and  consecrate  to You 
 What ere I  am  or  can,  as  Tribute,  due 
 To your  full-Sea,  from my  small-Rivolet, 
 Thus to  repay  some  part  of my great debt: 
 And since I  owe  more then I  know  to pay, 
 My  humble-All  rests to my dying-day 
 Your Honours and Worships
Sincerely to be commanded,
JOHN VICARS.
