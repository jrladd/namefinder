 My dearest friend, 
 S Ince it is the hard fortune of these  glow-worms  to see day, I wish they might have passed your examination; for I know you to be a severe Critick in  Poetry,  aswell as in  Philology,  and the Sciences: But since others importunities, and mine own pressing occasions, have denied it, I must present them loaden with their own blemishes, that being fitter Objects of Pardon, they may draw in pardoning, more demonstrations of your Candor, and adde to my Engagements, could they receive Augmentation. I will not commit a Rape upon your modesty by any praises, though Truth her self might be your  Panegyrist,  and yet continue naked; give me onely leave to tell you from mine own experience, that  Love  is more then a mere
 
 Sympathy:  for admiration did first attract my thoughts to you, and after fix them; though it were onely your innate sweetnesse that received them with an undeserved entertainment. Sir What I was first endebted to you at  Durham  I endeavour to acquit in part here at  Cambridge:  for the Totall, though it be rather above my ability, then desires, yet should I hate the thought of a Generall discharge, let me onely beg of you that these  Cherrystones  may draw from you your own  Pearls,  which cannot but break themselves a day through that darknesse to which you now confine them. Let us once see  Fancy  triumph in the spoyls of the richest Learning, there will many (no doubt) presse to follow the Chariot, yet shall none be more forward then 
 Sir, 
 Your most affectionately devoted servant J. HALL
