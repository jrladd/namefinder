 
 To the Right Honourable ROBERT Lord Viscount KILLMURREY my very worthy and much honoured Lord. 
 Right Honourable, 
 I T is not without example (which for the present I shall follow as a patterne) to dedicate to  one  a Letter written to  another,
 Bishop  Hall  wrote an Epistle to Mr.  I. B.  and dedicated it to his Father,  Decad.  1.  Epi.  10.  pag.  266. He wrote another to  W. E.  which he dedicated to M.  Robert Iermin Dec.  4.  Ep.  2.  p.  308. Another to M.  T. S.  and dedicated it to Sir  Fulk Grevell Dec.  6.  Epi.  2.  p.  349.  occasion  and  affection,  diversly inducing a diverse inscription:  That  directed me to write unto the Bishop,  This  to give your Lordship a title in the Publication of that I have written, as in acknowledgement of your ancient and constant kindnesse to me, neither cooled by age or interposition of time or place, nor laid aside with your honours, (which are wont to change manners) nor requiring more observances of me, than my manifold imployments would permit, nor
 excepting against mine omisions of attendance on your honour, (your wisdome and goodnesse truly and charitably interpreting them, rather as conformities to my calling, than as signes of slighting, or ingratitude.) To all this your Honour hath lately added a favour (which the lesse I thought of it before hand, the more I am bound for ever to remember it) in being so mindfull of the mending of my condition as to name me in a Petition to the high Court of Parliament, as worthy of better recompence of my paines, and cost in my pastorall charge than hitherto I have received. 
 Thus (my good Lord) while I am at greatest distance from you, you have drawn my devotions neerer to you, and have cherished them to a greater vigour of desire and indeavour to bee 
 as really as affectionately your Lordships humble Servant IOHN LEY. 
 From my lodging at the  Fountaine  in  Pauls  Church-yard  Feb.  13. 1640.
