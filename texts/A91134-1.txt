 Honoured Cousins, 
 I T is the nature of a Marygold to open its leaves to none but the Sun, despising all other lights; And he, pleased with so true a servant, (though poore in all things else) shines more graciously upon it then any other. The poorenesse of my merit may well parallel me to this flower: And the rich portion of your favours (whose beames excell that radiant Monarchs of the skie) you to him. My willingnesse to serve you, your commands shall never deny to be equall to my Presidents devotion to its Deity. These endeavours you have been pleased to stile worthy a welcome at your faire hands, when they were tendered to kisse them. Doing so now, you will adde to the engagements of him who is 
 Your cousin and servant  Thomas Prujean.
