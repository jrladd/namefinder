 
 
 To the worthy Gentlemen, and Inhabitants of the Parish of S t .  Andrews  HOLBORNE. 
 I  Hate Ingratitude as Witchcraft. To witnesse therefore to the world, both your curtesie to me, and my thankfulnesse to you, I give you this Piece, intended for your Pulpit; but being occasionally called to  Grayes-Inne,  delivered there what you should have heard, and but once; you may please now to see, and often, and in it the reality of my desire to retribute something: You know what S.  Peter  said to the Creeple,  What he had hee gave him:  you have been the chiefe preservers of me and mine, since our escape out of  Ireland,  where we had onely  our lives for a prey,  and those lives your bounty hath hitherto cherished. Which yet, doth not more obliege me, then the loving acceptance of my weak indeavours; with which
 
encouragement I shall chearfully proceed still in my poore labours, and shall think my self amid all my misfortunes very happy, if you shall so esteem of me as I am, and desire to expresse my selfe, 
 Yours in all faire respect,
 THO: ARTEFERTENSIS.
