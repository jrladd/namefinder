 
 
 To the Right Honourable My very good LORD,  HENRY  LORD Marquesse of  Dorchester,  Earle of KINGSTON,  &c.  AND One of the Lords of His MAIESTIES Most Honourable Privie Counsell. 
 My LORD; 
 T He secret love of  Hero  and  Leander  first brought to light in the pure  Greek  of divine  Musaeus,  was afterward
 
new moulded in  Latin  by the fluent  Ovid;  in imitation of whose Epistles, the most eminent Poëts of all Climates have (in their native languages) written upon  this subject  so many Paraphrases and Essayes, that like the numerous  streames  of  Nile,  they almost overflow the remembrance of their  Fountaine.  I confesse the report of Poëms  borrowed  from  Musaeus  made so great a noyse, that to mee the  Authour  had beene lost in the crowd of  Imitatours, 
 
if I had not heard his soft lines sweetned by your Lordship's accent; but then I could not be satisfied till I made triall how the  Greeke  would go in  English:  my intent being to  translate  and  dedicate  it  privately  to your Lordship. The  Translation  was forthwith dispatched, the  Dedication  is now presented, but the intended  Privacy  lay not in my power; for my acquaintance (who would know what I was doing) had ingaged me for so many Copies,
 
that I held it my safest course, rather to venture upon the Printers pardonable errours, then to runne the hazzard of grosse mistakes in ignorant Transcribers. Yet, as I could not make it altogether private, so I meant it should not be altogether publique, and therefore at first I suffered no more to be printed, then the just number promised. But now, finding so many freinds as challeng not a  few copies  but a  whole Impression.  I am forced to answer them, as  Pisistratus 
 
did his sons, that I have done my best to convert them to my Opinion, but since I cannot prevaile, I am resolved to be of theirs; and for their sakes, what I writ for my private excercise, shal be exposed to  common censure,  yet among the crowd of Readers if some  pretending Critick  shall assault me, I shall smile to see him retire with double speed, beholding the name of the illustrious and learned person that priviledges 
 Your Lordship's most humble servant, ROBERT STAPYLTON.
