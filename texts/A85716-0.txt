 I  Charge thee before God, who quickneth all things, and before Jesus Christ, who witnessed a good confession that thou read these Exhortations, meditate and teach them, unto others: that so thy profiting
 
may be known unto all men. Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. And the God of peace, who brought again from the dead Christ Jesus, that great Shepherd of our souls, through the bloud of the eternal covenant, establish thee unto every good work for the performance of his will; working in
 
thee that which is acceptable in his sight by Jesus Christ: These things I entreat thee, I exhort and beseech thee, who am 
 Cal.
 JAN.  1644. 
 Thy father▪  Harbottle Grimstone.
