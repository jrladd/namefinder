 
 To the Right HONOVRABLE THE LORDS Assembled in Parliament, The humble Petition of the Gentry, Ministry, and Commonalty of  Cleveland,  in the County of YORKE: 
 WHereas we know no other meanes under God, to divert the just Judgements which he hath executed against the Church of the  Laodiceans,  for the luke-warmenesse in Rebellion, or against the Church of  Thyatira,  for keeping Seducers, nor to prevent our eminent dangers, but by a most necessary and speedy executing of the Lawes of God and the King. We doe therefore desire to certifie, that we are resolved to live and dye in the Faith of the Protestant Religion; (knowing no other meanes of Salvation) and that we will defend it with our Lives and Goods, which that we may with our abilities, be encouraged in performing. 
 We humbly above all things desire, that wee may be secured, a happy Reformation aforded, and the Lawes of God and the King without favour or delay, justly put in execution against Papists.
