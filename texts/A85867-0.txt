 
 To his ever honoured  Valentine VVauton  Esquire, Colonell, and one of the Honorable House of Commons. As also to the other worthy Gentlemen; together with all the good people of the Parish of Great  Staughton  in the County of  Huntington. 
 SIR, 
 Y OU heresee, what the the rest of the Parish heard; under one moneths occasionall paines in my place. I am forced to make it publique, partly because I suffered some opposition & affront in my preaching, from
 
one I never saw before; and partly because some opinions of it are spread since, by and among those that know me not. But chiefely to answer the expectation of those amongst whom I am knowne. I hope (what I here tender you) will speake the Trueth of an honest Conscience to the World; the Affection of a carefull Pastor to the rest; and to you Sir! the gratefull (because much ingaged) mind of 
 Your humble Servant,
JOHN GAULE.
