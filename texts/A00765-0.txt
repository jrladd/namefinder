 
 TO THE VERY HONORABLE AND VERTVOVS LADYE THE LADYE ELIZABETH HERBERT, Wife to the honorable Sin Percy Herbert, of Powis Castle in Montgomerie shire. 
 M ADAME, 
 The noble favours I have received
 from your Ladishipp have not onely made me studious to preserve a gratefull mind in my selfe, But also encouraged me to vndertake these smal paines in your Ladyshipps behalfe. I know good MADAME, that by your dayly exercise in prayer, you have atteined to a great perfection in that art: Yet with all, I know your Ladishipps humilitie to be such, as you will not scorne nor disdeigne
 to better your knowledge from the instructions of the most able, and most pious vnderstanding of the age in which he lived. MADAME, I present heere vnto your Ladyshipp a Treatise of the most Reuerend Father Iohn Fisher Bishop of Rochester, Preist & most eminent Cardinall of the holy Roman Catholike Church; as you see, MADAME, sufficiently recommended hy those titles he deservedly
 obteined, correspondent to the vertues of his most holy and blessed life. My care hath onely been to render him faythfullie and for your Ladishipps benefitt, as the gravitie of the argument requires, not giuing him any other ornameÌ„t the that of truth, which I supposie makes it more agreable to your Ladyshipps vertues, and with all I desire, it may be accepted from him, who glories in nothing more
 then the title of beinge 
 MADAME,   Your Ladyshipps most humble servant and beadsman. R. A. B.
