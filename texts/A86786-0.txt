 
 
 TO The Reverend Mr.  John Arrowsmith  Master of St.  Iohns  Colledge in  Cambridge. 
 B Ut that ( Worthy  Sir) you know as well how to pardon
 
as judge, I might justly suspect your entertainment of these peices. Faint breathings of a minde burthened with other Literary employments, neither brought forth with Care, nor ripened with Age, yet such as if they bee not now blasted may be the first Fruits of a larger
 
Harvest; Let them Sir, Receive the honour and shelter of your Name, since borne under your Government, and cherisht by your Candor; That if they chance to survive their Father, they may testify hee was Sir 
 Your most humble Servant,  J. HALL.
