 SIR, 
 Y Our pious life, in fearing God, eschewing evill, and doing good; hath ever beene a lively Character to regulate my life by, and hath imboldened me to present and dedicate to your grave Patronage, and curteous acceptance, this Abstract taken out of a Commentary of Doctor  MARTYN LVTHER  upon the  Galathians,  a Coppy whereof I sent you a yeer since in writing, and now have published the same in Print, for the benefit of my friends and acquaintance, and all zealous, religious servants of the Lord; It containing in a few leaves, most excellent matter of saving Faith, which is,
 the Summe of Mans Salvation;   ely revealed, and set forth unto us,   the Old, and New Testament; which  osoever duely considers, (unlesse stu ied with supine carelesnesse, and be itched with the vaine pleasures & va ties of this world) will utterly despise,  d contemne all earthly and transitory  ings, and continually (being overcome  ith a divine rapture) meditate and con mplate upon eternall blessednesse; The  yes whereof, are more then ever eye  ath seen, the eare heard, or the heart of  an can conceive; Witnesse S t .  Paul, 2. Cor. 12.2.  who was caught up into the  ird Heaven; whither God Almighty I  ost humbly pray and beseech to bring  ou my deere loving Ʋncle, and all good  hristians, together with 
 Your obedient Nephew, and humble Servant.
