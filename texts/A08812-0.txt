 MOst Gracious Princesse, 
 Albeit to many there is not a more unpleasing sight and unwelcome message, then that vvhich puts upon the thoughts of Death: yet your Majesty hath not so learned Christ in those large lessons which by Divine Providence have been dispensed, to teach & affect with vvhat may be helpfull to Mortification. These Meditations of my deare husband of blessed memory, I have much longed to see clad in such wise as might be most serviceable, & that I my selfe might heare him being dead yet speake unto me comfortable words, to solace my soule in his absence, and to prepare me for the joyes into which he is entred before
 
me. My desires herein being accomplished, I make bold to present the same in the first place to your Majesties view, use and Patronage. The gentle & propitious respects your Majesty hath at sundry times manifested unto the Author & sometimes also to my selfe, give encouragement to presume that this testimony of thankfull acknowledgment & devoted affection (though but a widowes mite) shall obtaine your Highnesses gracious acceptance. The Most High, who ruleth in the kingdomes of men & giveth them to whomsoever he will, He rayse & establish your throne, & confirme it unto your Princely Progeny, that with His blessing the house of your Majesty may be blessed for ever. These are the unfained and earnest suites of 
 The meanest of your Majesties humble attendants at the throne of grace, BRIGET PAGET.
