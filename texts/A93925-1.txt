 
 To the Right Worshipshipfull the Major, Jurats, and Inhabitants of  Graves-end. 
 Brethren, 
 Y Ou may remember I was engaged to your reverend Pastor for an exchange upon necessary occasions: these conclusions I then delivered for substance to you, & I know not a materiall word varied. You know how it was calumnized, and with what bitternesse
 interpreted by him who heard it not, upon what grounds hee proceeded, I leave it to his owne serious thoughts. As they are and were I commend them to you, to judge whether the things are censurable or no. I must acknowledge your patience and candid acceptance of them then, and engage my selfe now and ever, 
 Your servant in the work of the Lord, Will: Sandbrooke. 
 Rochester,  Novemb. 20. 1646.
