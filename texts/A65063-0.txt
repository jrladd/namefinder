 
 TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE The House of PEERES Assembled in PARLIAMENT. 
 Right Honorable, 
 I  Have performed what service I am able to the memory of the renowned Lord, deceased, And to the Commands of that Right Honorable and Noble  Triumvirate  which gave being to this Sermon. And to your Lordships by whose Order I have adventured upon this
  Publication: All men (except such whose either morosity or malignity doth account,  vetera in laude, praesentià in fastidio)  must acknowledge the worth, the valour, the faithfulnesse which lie under the Robes you weare, and that it is not a meere borrowed Opinion which makes you Honorable, but the reflection or rebounding back of that upon you, which went first out from you: But this Sermon will teach you, that Titles of Honour are written in dust, and that Princes and great men must fall, their very Monuments are mortall, and will in time be found as  Archemedes  his Tomb (by  Cicero) in vepretis,  over-growne with Thorns and Bryers; and that light of memory which shines after your Sun-set, is but like the Moon which wanes also by degrees: No glory that's woven in the finest Tapestry of this world but will lose colour, decay, and perish, but saving grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ is   a
  possession for eternity, your zealous agency for the Church and State will carry you as far towards Immortality as any other Chariot in this world. Its as much as nothing when one can say no more of a man then is said of some great ones, that they  reigned  and  died.  The  Gen.  36. 33.  Lord give you hearts actuated with zeal for God, together with a right temperament of counsels, knowing that you are over a people who (as  Tacitus  saith)  nec totā servitutem pati possunt nec totam libertatem,  and if your fall do come before you see, or reap the fruit of your labours: The Lord make you such as may take comfort with you, and leave Honour behinde you, so prayeth 
 Your Lordships most humble and unworthy servant, in and for Jesus Christ, RICHARD VINES.
