 SIR, 
  Have found you so Noble in the first Dedication, that I should much derogate from your true Worth, and wrong my selfe to make choise of a new Patron
 
for the second (exactly done with applause) wherein though I presume, yet persume, t'will bee no sinne to multiply my obligation. Your name, and nature, claimes, and deserves it, 'tis your due and my duty, and were I able to expresse more  MOORE  should have it, for I must alwayes acknowledge your goodnesse in whatsoever quality for tune shall bestow me. SIR, I know you are wise. In a word I am, really what I am. 
 Your worships ever to be commanded. Ber. Alsop.
