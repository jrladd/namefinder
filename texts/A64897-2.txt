 
 
 TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL HIS MOST WORTHY and ever most highly  honoured  good  friends,  Sir RICHARD SPRIGNALL, Sir IOHN WOLLASTONE, Alderman PENNINGTON, and Alderman WARNER, Together with each of their most truly  virtuous  and  pious Consorts,  my  singular good friends;  All of them  eminent Patrons  and  Patterns  of  Piety, Vertue, Religion  and  Learning: J. V. unfainedly  prayeth the most  happie, fair  and  full fruition  of the  glorious effects  of the  plenarie-Reformation  intended by this  pious Parliament,  here; And of the  Saints celestiall beatificallvision,  in  Heaven,  hereafter. 
 H Aving by Gods good hand of  providence  and  direction (Right Worshipfull  and my most  highly honoured good friends)  undertaken a  subject  of  Gratitude  to our holy God in this succeeding  historicall narration  of all his  wonder-striking Parliamentarie-mercies  to us of this  English-Nation,  in generall; I could not but reflect my  serious thoughts  on your Worships as most worthie  objects  also of my  thankefull heart,  for many singular  favours  and  courtesies  toward me, in particular. And somuch the rather because of that which  Chrysostome,  in his 51  Homilie on Genesis,  hath as  sweetly  as  succinctly  touched.  Nihil tam gratum Deo & homini quam anima grata & gratias agens.  Nothing in the world is so  acceptable  to  God  or  man  as a  gratefull-heart  and a  thankefultongue.  The  due  and  deep  consideration whereof (I say) hath
 
made me  most desirous  (as  most bounden)  to tender this  umbl  and  plain-sti 'd historie  of Englands  God in the Mount of Mercies,   r, Englands  Remembrancer of gratitude  to God for all the  Parliamentarie  precious  blessings  most  fully  and  freely conferred;  or rather  poured-down  upon her within these 2  yeers  last past, as a  estimonie  of my most  thankfull-heart  to your good Worships for many both  publike  and  private favours  to  me  and  mine.  Which  historie  though I  ingenuously  acknowledge it might well have befitted a far more  fluent  and  high-soaring rhetori all-Penman  than my  poor  and  plain unworthie-self;  yet since it hath pleased the Lord that my poor  zeal  for Gods  glorie  hath thus  prevented them,  I most humbly  hope  and heartily  desire  candide and courteous  acceptance  of  it  and of my sincere  desire  and  endeavour, mainly,  to manifest my infinitely obliged  gratefull-heart,  first, to our  ever-living  and  ever-loving wonder-working  Lord God; next, to our most  Pious Patriots,  his  precious Agents  and  instruments  in these great and  glorious works;  and then to your  worthie selves  my much  honoured friends:  Which my endeavour  herein,  though  short  (I say) of your  judicious exp ctation,  and of the  histories  due  desert,  yet hoping it may remain as a  pledge  of my  plighted  humble  services  and bounden  gratitude,  and as the best  Barthol'mew-faring,  which my poor  abilitie  was able to present to your  good Worships,  with the  humble tender  also of m   heartiest poor prayers  to the throne of  grace  for all sanctified  sublunarie blessings  and  celestiall soul-cheering graces  on you and a l yours, I ever rest, 
 Your good Worships in the Lord, 
to be alwayes commanded, 
JOHN VICARS.
