 
 
 To the Young-men and Apprentices inhabiting within the City of  London. 
 I  Have presumed to dedicate this short Treatise to you, as having by long and sad experience found, that of all places in this Kingdome, this City, notwithstanding the great means which hath been used by the Magistrates to the contrary, is yet contaminated by the infamous vice of gaming, whereby many young-men of good education being sent from their parents in severall countries hither to gain a trade or way of living, have by sundry provocations been by little and little drawne to this vice, which having once used, they have found so much sweetnesse in this  dulee venenum,  that they have not left sucking this poysonous bait, till they have thereby brought themselves to much poverty, penury, want and misery, besides the consideration of the unbecommingnesse
 of so sensuall a vice in such sad and distracted times, wherein the judgments of God are in an extraordinary manner powred forth upon us; this and other sins, which this big-bellied monster (as the ensuing Treatise proves) daily produces and brings into the world, I could not but among the throng of Books (with which the presses have been a long time oppressed) but expose these few sheets to the publique view, which although it containe not in it matter of Newes, (a thing much sought after) yet the subject having not lately been treated of, may affoord new matter to the itching eares of many Athenians, and I doubt not but will find acceptance with all ingenious Patriots: I will not trouble you any longer with a tedious Induction, least I make too wide a doore for so mall a structure; but leave it to your perusall, hoping it may affoord some benefit to all honest Youth of the Kingdome in generall, and your selves in particular; with whom I leave my poore endeavours in this kind, and rest. 
 Your well-wishing Friend,  J. P.
