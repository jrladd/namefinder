 
 
 TO THE RIGHT Honourable, my very good LORD,  WILLIAM  Earle of  SALISBURY,  One of the LORDS of his Majesties most honorable privy Councell, and Knight of the most Noble Order of the GARTER. 
 W Hereas the manage of a real war, is now familiarly every mans Tract, the premises unconsulted, and our provisional Musters and  Militia  stil left at large, without any Paraphrase: my neare and usuall privitie with them both thus imposing; I have here propounded for some such temper, as might render each to be faire and flourishing: Neither
 
can it bee presented with more propriety, then to the masterwheele, from whose course and influence, my subordinate motion hath succeeded. And may your Lordship deigne it a favourable regard; I dare be bold (how defective perhaps in severall particulars) it shall yet induce so much discourse, and contemplation, as by hammering out infallible rules, may requisitely mature both. Finally, your gracious acceptation, of so meane a piece; will, beyond the many favours formerly collated, stil lay a further obligation, upon 
 Your Lordships ever bounden Servant,
 GEORGE TOOKE.
