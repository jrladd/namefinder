 Right HONOVRABLE, 
 I T is not any want of Bookes in these daies of ours, wherein they doe so much abound, that moves mee to publish these my weake labours, nor yet any desire I have to shew myself
 in  Print,  J am too sensible of mine owne imperfections, to be desirous to shew them to the World. But considering my engagments (especially to your  Honour ) and not willing to be altogether guilty of that hatefull sinne of ingratitude, but knowing no other way to expresse my thankefulnes J have pitched upon this, chooseing rather to shew my selfe a weake man, then ingratefull. J must confesse I had rather besilent, then be seen in  Print.  And my small fortunes, had made me as dejected in person as J was in place, untill it pleased your
 Honour  to cast the beames of your countenance on mee (in giving mee part of this  Lecture  where these  Sermons  were preached) which made me a little  erigere caput,  to peepe up, and shew my selfe, if to no other end then this (to expresse my thankfulnes it were a sufficient cause to move mee to it. J have heere endevoured to give unto your  Honour  not only what  Aeschines  gave unto  Socrates (me ipsū)  but even  Deum ipsum:  for it is an unfolding of some part of those Mysteries that concerne  Christ;  of whom your  Honour  is a livelie member in
 his  Church  militant, and will be untill you are a full partaker of all his benefits in the  Church  triumphant, which that your  Honour  may be is the prayer of 
 Your Lordships dayly  Orator,  and most humbly devoted Chaplaine. WILLIAM PARKES.
