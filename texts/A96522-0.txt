 
 
 TO THE HONOURABLE house of Commons, assembled in Parliament. 
 I   Should never have presumed to prefixe the name of this Honorable House to my Sermon, had I not beene incouraged therto, both by your protection and approbation. For though it was my hard lot to be suspended for preaching of it, (how justly you 
   have seene) yet it was my happinesse to have beene released by you. As for the entertainement and usage which both I and my Sermon have found from some, I wholly passe them over in silence, let it suffice that by the  Vindiciae  of this Honourable Court, I was freed from the censure imposed on me, and by your  Imprimatur,  it is now become  publici juris. Plinius Secundus  in his Epistle to  Vespasian  sayes, that many things seeme very precious for this very reason  quia templis sunt dicata:  and we know how that the Goats hayre and Badgers skins though of small value in themselves, yet did contract a reverent esteeme; being once dedicated
  to the Sanctuary. So this Sermon, which (that I may use the  Epigrammatists  word to  Domician)  from you hath received  vitam id est famam,  and which now casts it selfe at your tribunall, rejoycing to bear your Cognisance, may for this very reason, because of your name which is  praesidium & dulce decus meum,  find better acceptance, and a greater estimate, then it can challenge by any merit of its owne. 
 The onely tribute which I can returne, is to beseech Almighty God that he would be pleased to vouchsafe the gracious influence of his holy Spirit unto you, whereby the successe of your councels 
   may be as happie, as the hopes, and expectations be great: Let the beautie of the Lord be upon you, and establish the Worke of your hands upon us: This is the earnest praier of 
 Your most humble Servant, HENRY WILKINSON.
