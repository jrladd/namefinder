 
 TO MY MVCH HONOVRED, AND NO lesse truely beloved Friend EDVV. BENLOVVES  Esquire. 
 My deare Friend, 
 Y Ou have put the  Theorboe  into my hand; and I have played: You gave the Musitian the first encouragement; the Musicke returnes to you for Patronage. Had it been a light Ayre, no doubt but it had taken the most; and, among them, the worst: But being a grave
  Strayne, my hopes are, that it will please the best; and among them, You. Toyish Ayres please triviall eares; They kisse the fancy, and betray it: They cry,  Haile,  first; and, after,  Crucifie:  Let  Dorrs  delight to immerd themselves in dung, whilst  Eagles  scorn so poore a Game as Flies. Sir, you have Art, and Candor: Let the one judge, let the other excuse 
 Your most affectionate Friend, FRA. QUARLES.
