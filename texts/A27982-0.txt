 SIR, 
 I Presume to invite you to these sacred Nuptials: the Epithalamium sung by a crowned Muse. Never was there Paire of so divine a Beautie, nor united in such harmonious Affections: and infinitely he deserved her love; redeemed at so dear a Price, and inricht with so invaluable a Dowry. 
 SIR, Let me finde your Pardon for thus long continuing to make my Allay currant by the impression of your Name. Directed by your propitious Aspect, have I safely steered between so many Rocks; and now, arrived at my last Harbor, have broken up my ruinous Vessell. 
 The humblest of your Majesties Servants  George Sandys.
