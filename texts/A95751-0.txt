 
 
 TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, And most noble LADY, My deare and loving Mother, the Lady DOWAGER of  Cromartie. 
 MADAM, 
 F ILIALL duty being the more binding in me, that I doe owe it to the best of  Mothers;  if in the discharge thereof I observe not the usuall manner of other  sonnes,  I am the lesse to blame, that their obligation is not so great as mine: Therefore in that doe
 
presume to imprint your Ladiships name in the Frontispiece of this Book, and proffer unto you a Dedication of that, which is beyond the capacity of other  Ladies;  my boldnesse therein is the more excusable, that in your person the most  vertuous Woman  in the world is intreated to Patronize that, which by the  learnedest men  may happily be perused. 
 I am confident  (Madam)  that your gracious acceptance of this Present is the more easily obtainable, in that it is a grand-child of your own, whom I thus make tender of, to be sheltered under the favor of your protection; and that unto your Ladiship it will not be the more unwelcome, for proceeding from the braines of him, whose  body  is not more yours by  generation,  then by a most equitable  purchase  are the  faculties  of his mind; the  dominion  which over my better  halfe  you, by your  goodnesse,  have acquired, being, in regard of my obedience, no lesse  voluntary,  then that of the other is for procreation  naturall. 
 Thus  (Madam)  unto you doe I totally belong, but so, as that those exteriour parts of mine, which by birth are from your Ladiship derived, cannot be more fortunate in this their subjection (notwithstanding the egregious advantages of bloud, and
 
consanguinity thereby to them accruing) then my selfe am happy (as from my heart I doe acknowledge it) in the just right, your Ladiship hath to the eternall possession of the never-dying powers of my soule. For, though (Soveraignty excepted) there be none in this Island more honourably descended then is your Ladiship, nor whose progenitors, these many ages past, have been (on either side) of a more Noble extraction: Yet, laying apart  Nobility, beauty, wealth, parentage,  and  friends,  which (together with many other gifts of fortune) have hitherto served to adorn your Ladiship beyond others of your sex, who for all these have been deservedly renowned; and (in some measure) not esteeming that properly to be yours, the receiving whereof did not altogether depend upon your owne election: it is the treasure of those excellent graces, wherewith inwardly you are enriched, that, in praising of your Ladiship is most to be pitch'd upon, and for the which you are most highly to be commended; seeing by the means of them, you, from your tenderest yeeres upwards, untill this time, in the state of both  Æ²irginity  and  Matrimony,  have so constantly, and indefatigably proceeded in the course of  vertue,  with such alacrity fixed your gallant  thoughts  on the sweetnesse
 
thereof, and thereunto so firmly and cheerefully devoted all your  words  and  actions,  as if  righteousnesse  in your Ladiship had been an inbred quality, and that in your  Will  there had beene no aptitude of declining from the way of reason. 
 This much is sufficiently well known to those, that have at any time enjoyed the honour of your Ladiships conversation, by whose most unpartiall reports, the Splendour of your reputation is both in this, and foraine Nations accounted precious, in the minds even of those, that have never seen you. But in so much more especially, doe the most judicious of either sex admire the rare and sublime  endowments,  wherewith your Ladiship is  qualified,  that (as a patterne of perfection, worthy to be universally followed) other Ladies (of what dignity soever) are truly by them esteemed of the choiser merit, the nearer they draw to the Paragon proposed, and resemble your Ladiship; for that, by vertue of your beloved society, your neighbouring Countesses, and other greater Dames of your kindred and acquaintance, become the more illustrious in your imitation; amidst whom, as  Cynthia  amongst the obscurer Planets, your Ladiship shines, and darteth the Angelick rayes of your matchlesse example
 
on the spirits of those, who by their good  Genius  have been brought into your favourable presence to be enlightned by them. 
 Now  (Madam)  lest, by insisting any longer upon this straine, I should seeme to offend that modesty, and humility, which (without derogating from your heroick vertues) are seated in a considerable place of your soule, I will here, in all submission, most humbly take my leave of your Ladiship, and beseech Almighty God, that it may please his Divine Majesty so to blesse your Ladiship with continuance of dayes, that the sonnes of those whom I have not as yet begot, may attaine to the happinesse of presenting unto your Ladiship a brain-babe of more sufficiencie and consequence; and that your Ladiship may live with as much health, and prosperity, to accept thereof, and cherish it then, as (I hope) you doe now, at your vouchsafing to receive this, which (though disproportionable, both to your Ladiships high deserts, and to that fervencie of willingnesse in me, sometime to make offer of what is of better worth, and more sutable to the grandour of your acceptance) in all sincerity of heart (confiding in that candour and ingenuity, wherby your Ladiship is accustomed to value gifts,
 
according to the intention of the giver) and in all duty, and lowlinesse of mind, together with my selfe in whole, and all my best endeavours, I tender unto your Ladiship, as becometh,  (Madam) 
 Your Ladiships most affectionate Sonne and humble servant, THOMAS URQUHART.
