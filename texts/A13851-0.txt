 R. HONOVRABLE. 
 I  HERE adventure to present to your  Lordship  this Sermon  of the Praise and Worth of Wisdome.  Were the Discourse answerable to the Subject, it were
  a Treasure indeed and well worth the keeping, but the emptinesse of that may well giue the World just cause to think it to be, as it is, too far below the acceptance of so great a Personage, and my selfe so much the more unadvisedly bold in presenting the same unto You. However, it will not bee very seasonable to enlarge a Preface with variety of studied words and elaborate expressions
  for the obtaining of Your  Lordship's  favorable acceptation, but rather indeed to adventure on a second incongruous boldnesse in trespassing on Your wonted  Goodnesse  and dayly serious  Imployment:  whereof the One, as the world knows well, respecteth not so much a verball observance as plaine Honesty and Truth; and the Other, which duly is discharged in waiting on
  the service of GOD and Your KING, doth seldome give leave to spend much time in the reading of long Epistles and tedious Dedications. 
 Wherefore, to say all that is needfull in a litle, if any by reading this plaine Discourse shall be occasioned to entertaine one Thought of seeking after VVisdome more than before hee had, 'tis that which, God knoweth, was my ayme in the
  Publication thereof: and if, for this purpose, Your  Lordship  shall please to let it goe forth under Your Honourable Protection, and accept the Dedication of it as a true acknowledgment of that service, wherein I have stood long engaged, 'tis more than I deserve, and all that I doe or can desire. 
 God direct the hearts of all men to seek after that wisdome, which is
  acceptable and makes them such, who love it: and may the Gift thereof be ever multiplied on Your Honourable Family, to the magnifying of God's glory here, and Your's hereafter: which is the true desire and unfayned Prayer of 
 Your Lordships Humble Servant  HENRY TOZER.
