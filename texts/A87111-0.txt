Iohn Boys of the
Honourable Society of Graies
Inne Esquire, Counsellor at Law,
one of the Deputy Lieutenants of the County
Kent, and one of the Members of the
Honourable House of Commons. 
 Right Worshipfull: 
 W Hen  Appolonius  desired
 Vespasian  the Emperour,
that he would
give entrance and accesse
to  Dion,  and  Euphrates,  two
Philosophers, he thus answered;
 .
I have my Gates alwaies open to
Phisosophers; but even my very
breast is open to thee. Let your
Gates be open to all true lovers
of  Arts  and  Sciences,  that so learning
may be advanced, and its
lovers  encouraged;  and let your
 
eares be open to the  Parliaments 
servitours, that so  desert  may be
rewarded, and the laborious  animated. 
I have laboured  day  and
 night  in the Parliaments Service,
and have had some encouragement
from your Worship, and
other of the Right Worshipfull
Deputy Lievtenants, as likewise
from Captaine  Andrew Ball  at
Walmer Castle, to whom I am
not unthankfull; but I must confesse
I have found slight respects
of some, who have been to me
ingrate; that was my comfort,
this my grief. As  Walmer  n Kenr.  Now go on (Right
Worshipfull) with truth, equity,
and justice, that God may blesse
your great designs and weighty
affairs for  Englands Parliament. 
 So prayeth 
 your Worships humble devoted. Henry Harflete.
