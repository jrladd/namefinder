 
 TO THE HONOVRABLE House of  Commons  assembled in  PARLIAMENT. 
 T Here it to me nothing more imperious then the request of that Authoritie, which might enforce, and unto which this whole Kingdome oweth so much of thankfulnesse and dutie. By such your Command, this Sermon is made publike, which by the same was preached in your honourable audience. I know it will now want that little life it seem'd to have when it was uttered  viva voce,  and entertained with your chearfull and religious attention. 
 I am not of his minde that said,   Segnius irritant animos dimissa per aures, Quam quae sunt oculis commissa â€”Hor. de Art. Poet.   Things move more dully by the ear then by the eye; nor doth that reason sway me that another gives,    Damas. Orth. Fid. lib. a. c. 18.  The eye seeth by direct lines, but the
  ear takes in things  (after a more squandring manner)  every way.  That which the Philosopher saith of knowledge, the Apostle saith of  faith, It comes by hearing,  Rom. 10. 17. I confesse, memory is fraile; and to reflect again, by reading, upon that w ch  we have heard, may conduce much unto the improvement of our knowledge in such things as wee desire to put in practice. This I presume is your desire    Agapet. paraen. ad Justinian. 57 ,  and I pray God the same may be in all, whose eyes may now reach that which their ears could not before. The Text it selfe holds forth the practice of the Saints of God of old, in all their troubles; which patterne if we follow faithfully, God in his good time will so blesse your most unwearied travails for the publike safetie, that wee shall see his great deliverance wrought by your hands, according to the poore weak prayers of 
 Your obliged servant in the Lord, Peter Smith.
