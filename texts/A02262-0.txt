 SIR, 
 IAm bold to present you with this Peece of the PASSION, the Originall designed by the curious Pensill of  Grotius:  whose former afflictions seeme to have taught him pliable passions, and art to rule the affections of others: cloathing the saddest of Subjects in the sutable attire of Tragedy; not without the Example of two ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church,  Apollinarius  and  Nazianzen.  The Argument is
 
of both the Testaments a patheticall Abstract. Those formidable Wonders, effected by God in his owne Common-wealth; those stupendious Miracles, for truth a Pattern to all History, for strangenesse to all Fables; here meet together to attend on CHRIST'S PASSION. The effects of his Power here sweetly end in those of his Mercy: and that terrible Lord of Hosts, is now this meeke God of Peace; reconciling all to one another, and Man-kinde to Him-selfe. S r . in this change of Language I am no punctuall Interpreter: a way as servill as ungracefull.  Quintilian  censures a Painter,
 
that he more affected Similitude then Beauty; who would have shown greater Skill, if lesse of Resemblance: the same in Poetry is condemned by  Horace;  of that Art the great Law-giver. Thus in the Shadow of your Absence, dismist from Arms by an Act of Time, have I, in what I was able, continued to serve you. 
 The humblest of your Majesties Servants, GEORGE SANDYS.
