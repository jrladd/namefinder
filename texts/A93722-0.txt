 I T is reported of a great  Persian Monarke,  that having lost his royall Consort, he was so deeply affected with sorrow, as that he refused to admit of any comfort: In this height of passion, a certaine  Philosopher  vndertooke, if that he would furnish him with things necessarie for his purpose, to raise the  dead Queen  againe: the  Empirour  much taken with the  offer,  was willing for that end, to exhaust all his  Treasures:  but the other only demanded of him three names of such persons as had never felt any greife or sadnesse, to engrave them on the  Queens  Monument: which after much search throughout his  Empire  could not be found. I to the restoring of this bleeding & dying  Kingdom,  whose wounds every day grow wider and wider, shall not desire the names of any such persons as have been altogether strangers vnto sorrow and humiliation, they being those that have drawne the heaviest judgments vpon it; but the names of such as have been reall and solemne mourners before God in the behalfe of this  Land,  which if in any competent number they may be found, I shall not feare but this  Kingdome  may see a glorious and happy  resurrection. 
 This affection of sorrow is that which this  Sermon  did first call for, from the  Pulpit,  and doth still continue (being published by your Command) to doe it from the  Presse,  as being the most sutable posture and dresse to the present conditon of this  Land,  it cals and invites all, to an holy mourning
  and humiliatiation before the Lord, whose sinnes have bin as oyle to the lampe, and fuell vnto the fire, to feed and nourish that displeasure, that burnes in the bowels of the  Kingdome,  But more especially your  Honours,  who are the  two eyes  of the  Kingdome  not only to watch over it for it's good, but to mourne over it for it's sinnes and miserie: not only to be  Reformers  of it, but  Weepers  for it. And the  first stones  of  Reformation,  which are not like the  foundation  of the  Temple,  that was laid with the  weepings  of the old men, and the  shoutings  of the young men, but with the bitter mourning of all sorts will (I doubt not) in the finishing, and perfecting of the worke receive the joyfull acclamations both of young and old, both of  Governours  and  People,  the God of Heaven himselfe turning our water into wine on the wet  seed-time  of  teares,  into an  harvest  of  joy  and spirituall blessings: which that he may speedily doe, prayes, 
 Your Honours to serve you for Christ. WILLIAM SPURSTOWE.
