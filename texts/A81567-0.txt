CARINDA. 
 MADAM, 
 I T was your pleasure not long since
to admit me into your Ladiships
presence, where I tooke the boldnesse
to begin a discourse of the
Planets, and to declare the power
of them: which conference d d
arise from the death of Sir  Thomas Wentworth, 
who departed this world in his Clymactericall
yeare. A friend of mine being at the place
of execution, heard a pittifull Lady warble forth
a mournfull duty; and as soone as her eyes beheld
his head parted from his shoulders, she uttered
these words with teares in her eyes, (O what
wit, treson, harmes) which being examined,
were the true letters of (Six  Thomas Wentworth )
without adding or taking away of a letter.
Well might she confidently affirme what she
said, since none will deny, but that the cutting off
the head spoyles the wit. I have according
to your Ladiships command, sent you this dream
 
of the Lord of Strafford, in regard formerly you
have been pleased to lend an eare to my tedious
relation; the which is included within a small
treatise, stiled,  the Divine Dreamer,  together
with the service 
 Of  your Servant
GONZALO.
