 Friends, 
 _ H Aving by the especial help of my God, finished and published a Collection
 of his promises of good things to us: I here present you with some Vowes, of our obedience unto him: Had not my imployments for the Publique hindred, I had by the LORDS assistance, plainly proved every Particular, by expresse places of Scriptures; but I hope all is so consonant to sound Doctrine, and the patterne of wholesome words, that there needs
 no dispute, I know in these high flying times, such meane matters as these, are with many of small esteeme: However, I humbly leave them to the due consideration of godly, meeke and judicious minded men, desiring all may be for Christian satisfaction, and no way tend to unedifying contention; they concerne Souldiers especially in many particulars: Well, such as
 the Worke is, if you please to accept, and make good use of it, 'tis all I desire from you for it. Farewell in Christ our Redemer,  Amen.
