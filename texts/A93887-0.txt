 The Lord  John de Reede,  Lord of  Reinswond,  Deputy in Ordinary in the Assembly of the States Generall of the united Provinces for the Province of  Utrecht.

 Lords Ambassadours of the High and Mighty Lords, the States Generall of the united Provinces of the Netherlands. 
 
 T He World, happily, will conceive, that Personages so Noble and Eminent for Place and Employment, are much too High to be solicited to undertake for, or be God-Fathers to a Childe of so mean a Birth and quality, as is this that now presents it self unto Your Excellencies for that purpose. Every one will be ready to say, that I, in making choice of Your Honourable Names, for Protection of this Treatise, have erected too stately, and augustuous a Portall, for so low and mean a Building, as mine is: It may not be denied, but that such a construction may very justly be made of my enterprise, if either the Authors inferior quality and condition, or the frame and structure of his work should be strictly eyed, and regarded. But on the other side, if the matter and end of it, be well taken into consideration, scarce any man can think other, then that it is most worthy Your Patronage; as that, that hath no other aime, save only the glory of God, the Edification of the Church, the Vindication of the Truth, against the illusions of Sectaries and Novelists, and the reduction to the bosome of the Church, of such as are strayed from it. Now, what can there be more sutable, and fitting for Children, and Servants of the great God, such as as You are, then that which makes for the advancement of his Glory? What can there be more proper for such as are Members, yea Nursing-Fathers of the Church, then that which tends to the gathering and Uniting together of the Members of
 her Body? What can there be more worthy such Eminent Personages, professing the true Religion, then that which is for the defence of the truth of such opinions as are Orthodox? What can there be more corresponding with the duty of Chistian Magistrates, then to that which is intended for the reduction of such as are strayed to the Sheepfold of the great Shepherd of our Souls, and that They should assist the Work by their Politicall Authority, whilst the Church contributes (which is all she can do) her best Reasons for their conviction. I have further Grounds and Motives for the Dedication of this Treatise to Your Excellencies: to wit, For that You represent here the Persons of the High and Mighty States of the United Provinces; some of whose Territories and Estates are infected with this Venome: Howbeit, God be thanked, it gaines not ground so fast there as here, nor the Gangreen proves hitherto so dangerous: Concerns it not us therefore, being infested with the same Malady, and Disease, the one as the other, that we should testifie our mutuall sense and apprehension thereof; and that we should make it appear to all the World, that however we are divided in Body, we are yet notwithstanding strongly united in Heart; as also in an Harmony of Opinions: You labour likewise, how You may Establish here a Peace, both in Church and State; and this Treatise is a good Means, conducing to the former of these: You endevour to procure a Generall Councell; and this Treatise maintaines the equity, and proves the necessity of it. 
 But yet there is one Reason more which more particularly obliges me to present this Treatise to Your Excellencies; and it is such as I may not at any hand passe over, without incurring the Crime of highest Ingratitude: Which is, Most Excellent Lords, That great Honour Your Famous University of  Leyden,  the very  Athens  of our Age, hath put upon me, in vouchsafing me so honorable a Call to be one of its Members; Truly to this Head give me leave to say, I cannot sufficiently admire Your great love to good Letters, and Your unparallel'd care for the advancing of them; so as it seems, that in Your Provinces, and in them alone they flourish and shew themselves in their perfect Lustre and Beauty. For this purpose
 You from time to time, make choice and Election of the most Famous men of all  Europe ) Notwithstanding, that You have very able men of your own) as though You meant to gather into one Place all the most radiant Stars in the Firmament; so as You despoil all other Kingdoms of the fairest flowers of their Crowns, and with a kinde of sweet violence do, as it were, draw their Eyes out of their Heads, and so quite darken and eclipse their Lustre and shine. I say not this, that I would be thought to rank my self in the number of those Great and Eminent Personages: I know well, that there are some Stars that shine by their own light; That there are others again that shew not themselves, but by a borrowed light: But I will not enlarge my discourse upon Your Praises, nor undertake to describe at large Your Heroick Vertues; for this is not the place for it; and it hath already been done by far better Pens then mine is; I should by such an untertaking fear to sully the brightnesse of their Lustre, and to draw a cloud over their Orient and vivid Colours; And if I should go about it, I should at the same time resolve, to imitate that Excellent Painter, who, when he had done all that his Art enabled him to do, for the drawing of an exquisite Pourtaicture, and had set out its beauty with the most lively colours he could devise, drew a curtain over it, mistrusting the goodnesse of his Workmanship, and intimating thereby, that there was much more to be conceived of the Peece, then he was able to expresse. 
 Notwithstanding, I cannot tell how to contain my self, but I must take notice of Your great Actions, and Your many Noble Atchievements by Arms: How You were They, that first oppos'd Your selves to the Tyranny of the proud Spanyard; and that first of all others, stayed the violent course of his Conquests, that like an impetuous Torrent, was wont to bear down all before him: So as from a very meane and low beginning, of a suddain He was become so excessively great by possessing himself of the most commodious and considerable Estates of the World, as that he was come to reckon his Crowns by Hundreds, and Thousands. Yet You, that were but the least part of His Estates, and that were accompted no better then Beggars & Gueux,
 in comparison of those vast Treasures that He drew from  Peru;  You I say, were They that first blunted the edge of His Conquests, and knapt in sunder the Bonds wherewith he would have enslav'd You, setting Free, and at Liberty together with Your selves multitudes, of others whom He out of an insatiable Appetite, not knowing how to set limits or bounds to his over-swelling Ambition, had fully purposed to make his Vassalls. Moreover, You constrained him, though much against stomack, to acknowledge You for Soveraigns, & such as depended not at all upon upon His Jurisdiction. And not contenting Your selves with all this, You went and found him out in his own Hereditary Estates, and pursued Him with fire and sword, even to his own doores. Yea, You Traversed God knows how many Seas, as wel towards the East, as the West, setting at liberty those poor Barbarians, over whose Bodies he exercised so many cruell and new devised Tyrannies; and all this under the pretext of a false Donation by the Bishop of  Rome.  And as if You had not an Adversary at home, that would cut You out businesse enough, nor an Object sufficient to entertain You, You set Your selves on work to discover severall Lands, that were altogether unknown to former Ages the which You subjected to Your own Dominions: But yet all these Politicall and Martial Vertues, are nothing in comparison of Your Christian Vertues, and Your Zeal to the Reformed Religion; For no sooner had You freed Your selves from the Yoak of the Spanyard; but You willingly submitted Your necks to the service of the Son of God, and made Your Country a Sanctuary, and Refuge to the poor Protestants, whether persecuted in  France  or elsewhere. 
 And those Barbarians, that You subjugated in  Asia,  and  America,  You subdued no lesse to the Kingdom of the Son of God, then to Your own Signory; so joyning the glory of God together with Your own Interests, and enlarging the Empire of his Son with Your own; and marrying (which is rarely seen, and therefore seems almost impossible) the  Maxims  of  State,  and the  Principles  of  Religion  together; Evidencing it to the whole world, that You are no lesse good Christians, then great Polititians. 
 
  These are the Reasons, Most Excellent Lords, that moved me to Dedicate this small Treatise to Your Excellencies: to wit, Your great Zeal for the glory of God, and the Edification of his Church; Your present worthy Employment and Embassy, Your Troubles in Religion alike with ours; and particularly, the Honor which one of Your Universities hath lately conferred upon me. 
 Now I beseech God to give You length of dayes, with all sort of Temporall Happinesse in this World; and to heap upon You Eternall Blessings in the World to come: To powre out the most benigne and pretious influence of his Grace upon Your flourishing Estates & Provinces; to blesse all Your worthy undertakings; to make You proceed as You have begun, and to give You evermore Victory over all Your Enemies, both Spirituall and Temporall, to the end Your Signories may continue as firm and stable as the Heavens. So prayeth he, that is ever Obliged to remain, 
 Your EXCELLENCIES Most humble and obedient servant, ADAM STEUART.
