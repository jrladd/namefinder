 
 
 To his truly Honoured Friend, Master
JOHN THOMPSON, of the City of
LONDON Merchant. 
 SIR, 
 A S in those more painfull imployments
you formerly underwent in Transmarine
parts you did with great fidelitie,
courage, and industry for sundry
yeers, mannage the affaires of our  English 
Merchants intrusted to your care
and discretion: So now in this your present retirement,
your continuall Study makes it manifest, you
act not the part of a young man (though your yeeres
speake you not aged) but like a wise man (that ever
husbands Time with advantage) You enrich your
minde with Knowledge, Converse amongst Studies,
and with Authors of wisedome, that hereafter you
may be more serviceable to your Country as opportunitie
shall present you with a fit occasion: I shall
not neede acquaint the World, that you have (as we
say changed heaven) and lived not further then five
 
degrees from the Aequinoctiall; yet have you still remained
your selfe, and twice returned  Statu quo,  bettered
by your travells. 
 This little Treatise (of lesse worth then I wish it) I
present unto you, and desire your perusall by way of
Recreation, (I am not singular in Dedicating a small
thing to a worthy Friend:  Iohn Dee  a most Learned
man Dedicated his  Aphorismes  to  Gerard Mercator  a
man famous, and they consisted of lesse then sixe
sheets.) 
 Wearied I say with more weighty Studies, run over
this, and the rather, because its the first in this kinde
ever wrote by any: and you can judge whether 'tis
well or ill done, and few else: Your selfe have seene it
in loose papers, from the beginning, middle, and to
the end of it, are able to testifie its my owne, I borrowed
it from no man, (that impertinent Traveller
spoake by Authority, who hoodwinked in judgement,
bleated openly that others performed my
Worke, yet he never saw me.) 
 Sir, Favour me with as much love in Receiving it
humanely, as I in Affection tender it unto You,
and You engage me to rest, 
 Your Reall Friend,
WILLIAM LILLY.
