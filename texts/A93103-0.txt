 
 TO The Renowmed, Valiant, Pious, and worthily Honoured, SIR  THOMAS FAIRFAX,  Captain Generall of the Forces raised by the Parliament of  England,  for the defence of His Majesties person, and priviledge of Parliament, and the liberty of the Subject. 
 SIR, 
 H Aving for the satisfaction of some Friends of mine, penned a Summary or brief collection of your worthy Acts, and never to bee forgotten Archievements, for your Countrey, this last remarkable yeare, as, I hope, I truly say, and we effectually finde of our deliverance from those calamities which some few years since we had little reason but to expect. I could not
  finde a worthier or meeter person to whom I might dedicate these my labours, then your selfe: one principall reason therefore, that you whose name is a terror to the enemies of Christ, might also be as a Buckler to defend this Work, which I ingeniously confesse was not compiled by me, wholy for lucre of gain, but out of an ardent and hearty affection I beare to your person, and the honour that I and all men ought to acknowledge your due. I know, Sir, that my language hath not fitted a matter of high concernment, which would deserve the pen of another  Tacitus:  But I hope, Sir, that your Honour will as cordially accept the indeavour of the meanest Souldier vnder you, as of the noblest Captain: Thus, Sir, not desiring to be guilty of writing a large Epistle to a short Treatise, I cease, and shall ever remain, as is my bounden duty, 
 Your Honours most humble Servant;  S. SHEPPARD.
