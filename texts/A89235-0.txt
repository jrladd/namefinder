 
 
 To the most Sacred MAJESTY OF Henrietta Maria, Daughter of  France,  and Queen of  Great Britain. 
 MADAM, 
 T He propriety of my Life is not simply by a common Right inherent in Your  Crown,  but likewise (by a special and notorious Purchase) is annexed unto Your  Person;  and that by so obliging a Title, as nothing less then the cessation of my Life, could seem on my part a legitimate separation of my personal Services from Your  Majesty▪  But in this
 
engaged estate of my life, God hath been pleased, by a civil death, to contrive a justifiable intermission of my secular Duties, and by such away, as renders even this cessant state in some sort active, and discharging my Obligations: Since my present suspended condition is a consequence of the active prosecution of my Duty to Your  Majesty,  whereby even this my inanimate constitution, in regard of any motion in Your service, seems enlivened by this kinde of dying in that relation; by which means my life may be said to have but changed the maner of application unto You, and in place of the Spirit of Acting, to have taken that of Suffering for Your Service; So that in effect, it is but the corps, as it were, of my time that lieth thus into  bed in this Region of civil death, while the Spirit thereof liveth in Your Service, by the occasion of this my passive condition. 
 In this state of violent quiescence, my thoughts  (Madam)  have not ceased to range
 
and cast about in these spacious fields of  Solitude,  to finde a way, how, my person being now like a Clock with a broken  Spring,  unable to give You an account of my time by my own Motion, I might contrive my present state, as it were, into a  Sun-dyal,  which while it self is fixed, doth by an extrinsique Motion give an account of Time: In some report to this Conceit, I have bethought my self of drawing some such lines within my walls, by the rules of  Spiritual Mathematiques,  as might (by the Motion of that Sun upon them, which commonly shines the brightest through the closest walls of Prisons, they like Chrystal curtains, intending rather then intercepting his beams) render You,  Madam,  an account hereafter of my present time, by the strange property of this Spiritual  Dyal,  which may mark out the passage, even of hours already elapsed: And, I hope, these lines have yet this better quality, of bearing some marks of the fervor and operation of this Sun upon my thoughts,
 
as of their course and motion towards Your Memory; which Impression if they retain, this one act doth happily conjoyn these two great Duties, of  Gratitude  to God, and to Your  Majesty. 
 In my present conveniency  (Madam)  of contemplating much these two subjects, I have often resolved, That God had designed You so specially, for the mediate conveyance of all his Blessings to me, as that he would not minister this his Medicinal affliction, but as it were by the hand of Your Service; by which order he hath been pleased to render Your adversity more beneficial to me, then ever Your felicity was like to prove, since it is not probable that Your Power would have given me what I finde now to have been most wanting to my Life,  Sufferance  and  Mortification;  insomuch, as what my vain Nature needed the most, and Your generous one, could afford me the least, hath by the accidents of Your fortune,
 
binfurnished me, with the preservation of Your favorable constancy; and thus, without the blemish of any of Your Vertues, Your Service hath taught me  Patience  and  Resignation;  Vertues, which though You had them habitually in Your minde, yet neither were Your Nature or Your Fortune, the one apt, or the other proper, to give Your Servants occasion to practice them. 
 Nor doth this my particular blessing of Sufferance, endure any abatement by the sense of Your personal afflictions; for GOD hath provided against this allay of it, by the improvement, at the same time, of all Your Vertues and Pieties; So, as in respect of Your Person, I may rejoyce likewise in all Your tribulations, since every Thorn in Your present  Crown  hath been a kinde of pensil, the sharpest touches whereof have drawn You the nearer that  original Head,  crowned with Thorns, whose resemblance ought to be Your principal intendment: And if what You have lost of the likeness of a Terrestrial Prince, hath
 
conferred to Your similitude with that  King of kings,  there is made a blessed Transfiguration, rather then any Disfigurement of Your Image: Wherefore I may presume  (Madam)  That all the present Breaches which Your  Crosses  have made in Your Temporal state, will prove in Your Eternal like the wounds of our great  King  of the  Cross,  which are turned into the most glorious and resplendent parts of his Body. 
 It were easie  (Madam)  to present You many Motives of  Consolation,  derived from the subject of Your Troubles; but I had rather You should extract them from that part therein, which solaceth all Your Attendants in this hard Fortune, the resigned maner (I mean) and temper of Your Suffering, and that which easeth Your Servants is the likeliest thing to confort You in this condition. You may therefore safely rejoyce, that Your comportment supplieth much the disablement of Your Fortune, and in some degree relieveth all Your
 
distressed Party, while Your Gracious precedence in this asperous and narrow way of the  Cross  (wherein Your Vertue doth prescribe the order of their march) may well draw every generous Minde off from the thoughts of their own private Distresses, and so succor the noblest Hearts in some measure, by this vertuous diversion, while You are unable to do it by direct supplies: Thus, by the influence of Your Piety, even Your Necessities may become Provisions for Your Suffering Party. 
 Thus did  King David  refresh more his  Paral. 11. 18.  whole Army, by bearing them company in their thirst, then he could have done by the provision of many vessels of water and as this holy  King  did as good as cast that water into every thirsting mouth, which he poured out unto the  Lord;  so may You,  Madam,  by accepting still chearfully Your own wants, and offering up to God Your Will of suffering in this general Calamity, relieve more universally Your Party, then by the distribution

of a great treasure; and this may pass for an agreeable motive to You, to attend the improvement of Your Piety, the expecting by the degrees of Your advance in sanctity, not onely the ministring a good proportion of spiritual confort to Your distressed Servants, but likewise the propitiating of Almighty GOD, towards Your reinablement to afford them, all other succors, whereof Your ROYAL HEART can make a  Designation; and likewise by these Arguments of Your holy cariage in this affliction, Your Loyal Subjects may be perswaded to expect all Your heart can promise them, justly concluding of Your Case, what was presaged of holy  DAVID  in his Exite,  Now we know certainly, that You shall reign, and the Kingdom shall be established in Your hand. 
 Had I not,  Madam,  a better reason, then the circumstance of my present condition, I should, per adventure, give more liberty to my
 
Opinion, and impress more livelily by my Pen the signature of my Thoughts upon these Papers, as the true figure of Your Vertue and Merit in these unhappy occasions: But Your Vertue it self forbids me more then any other reflexion, knowing that the charges of Your Duties are welcomer to You, then even the due proclamation of Your Praises; in which regard, although it might seem a Service to the Nation, to endeavor by some respects and civilities to Your  Majesty,  the purging a little our Language, of some disloyal rudeness and barbarisms that have of late vitiated much this Tongue; yet will I prefer the satisfaction of Your Modesty and Humility, before the reparation of our own concernments: And surely,  Madam,  they who have the honor to know You particularly, may conclude the pleasingest way of righting You, to be the leaving You the most to forgive those who have misunderstood You. 
 I shall therefore rather humbly commend
 
unto You, the progress and advance of Your Pieties, then offer You any reparatory commendations; since by the cand r of Your Charity, You may turn every bl opt upon Your Name, into a beam of Splendor shining on it in the Book of Life; and whatsoever seemeth now a fear upon Your Person, may by the vertue of Your Patience, prove as it were so many several Stars composing one glorious Constallation of such Merits, whereof the Prophet  Daniel  saith,  They shall prove   Dan. 12. 3 .   like the splendor of the Firmament, and like  STARS  shining in perpetual Eternities. 
 Now  (Madam)  studying what I should say, to recommend this Offering to Your Sacred  Majestie,  I finde the nature of it to be such, as rather prescribes me Prayers for the Acceptation, then allows me to make Promises for the worthiness of the Present; For such is the order observable in our Oblations to GOD, and to his most special
 
Images on Earth; unto whom, as to himself, Servants do likewise not pretend to give towards the enriching them, but in order to their own Discharges: So  (Madam)  do I not presume by this Offering of my Thoughts, to supply You with any New Lights requis  for Your advance in Devotion, but rather to rejoyce Your Charity, by shewing it how my little Stock profits in this Royal Exchange of the  Cross,  better then in the Treasury of the  Court:  Nor can I conclude this account of my Time, wholly useless to Your perfection; For, as Princes do often build their Pallaces by the same Models which inferior persons use for their houses, enlarging onely the Dimensions, with observance of the same Figure; So  (Madam)  peradventure this Draught of Devotion, formed in these Lines, may not seem unfit for Your great Soul, in point of Figure and Order, while You may raise Your Zeal upon it with great excesses, in respect of the
 
measures and proportions: But this I may modestly presume, That though these lines do not pretend to be exactly fit for Your Soul, as a model of Devotion; yet they need no enlargement, as they are a Draught and Design of my Gratitude: In which relation, nothing can be more accomplished, then the Thoughts and Vows, of 
 Your Majesties most dutiful Subject, and most obliged Servant.
