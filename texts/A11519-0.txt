 
 The History of the Inquisition, and particularly o  the  Venetian.  With the Motives which caused that most Renowned Common-Wealth of  Venice  to make divers Ordinances touching this matter. 
 To the Most Renowned Duke of  Venice: F. P. V. S.  wisheth all happinesse. 
 P ERFORMING with all due reverence the command laid on me by your Highnesse to draw unto a head, and set downe in order all matters which concerne the Office of the Inquisition against Heresie: I have found all things so well ordered in times past, by the Counsells of this most Renowned Common-wealth, that there needeth no other thing to be done, but onely to put together that which on divers occasions hath beene determined, bringing to passe that which was deliberated by the most excellent Councell of Ten, and in the yeare 1550. the 22 of  November,  the 8 Chap.  vid.  that throughout all the  Venetian  Dominion should bee an uniforme
 
proceeding, and conformable to what is observed within this renowned City: As also it was agreed upon betweene Pope  Julius  the third, and this most illustrious Common-Wealth, in the yeare 1551. Chap. 18. 19. 
 Which in my respectfull opinion may easily be done, if the orders made upon severall occasions be reduced unto Chapters, and thence as it were a recapitulation framed, wherein shall briefly and summarily be set downe so much as is necessary to be observed, and Copies may be given either of the Heads alone, or joyned with the aforesaid determination it shall seeme best. 
 I will first gather the Heads, then will I adde the considerations and causes for which these Orders were first established to the Honour of God; for the which it is also necessary to continue the keeping of them, for the maintenance of holy Religion, and publicke quietnesse.
