 MOTHER, 
 H Aving from your breasts received the first nutriture of my body,
  and by your dayly admonition and wholesome counsell a better aliment for the preservation of my soule to whome then could I more fitly dedicate those my younger blossoms of experience (next unto  God  my  spirituall Father  and the  Church  my  spirituall Mother)  then to you my carefull  naturall Mother?  the Travayle, and payne you
  endured at my byrth was much, and for that I must ever owe you much obedience; but what of that? had you only brought mee into this miserable world, and there left mee  sine cognitione dei  without the knowledge of a  better,  I had not beene much the  better,  nay farre  worse:  that I have not let the Counsell fall to the ground, but by the help of my
  God made a hopefull improvement, let these ensuing lines bee an obedient Testimoniall: to your perusal I leave them, that the Armour therein mentioned may be your furinture,  that those evills which the craft, and subtility of the Devill, or man worketh agaynst you may bee brought to nought,  that in the end you may receive a Crowne
  of Righteousnesse shall bee the prayer of 
 Your obedient Sonne. E. T.
