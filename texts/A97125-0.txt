 
 TO THE
HONOVRABLE
House of COMMONS
Assembled in Parliament. 
 A T  your Command  this Sermon
was Preached, by
 your Order  it hath been
Printed, and now its
humbly offered to  your
hands,  and under your
Honourable Patronage made Publque to
the view of the world. I know well that
 the same  Sermon,  as to the life of it,  is
scarcely  the same  in the  hearing,  and in the
 reading:  But that  acceptation  which it
found when it came froÌ„ the  Pulpit,  gives
 
me hope that it will not be cast aside, as
disrelishing or unprofitable; now its
come from the  Presse.  The Lord command
a blessing along with it unto  you, 
and make  you  and  your  unwearied labours,
a blessing to the Church and Kingdome. 
 So prays
Your most unworthy servant
in the work of the Ministerie.
 IOHN WARD.
