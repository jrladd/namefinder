 HAving (most Honoured Lady) perused the  Lamentations  of  Jeremiah,  I found them sutable to the Complaints of  England;  and when I called to minde, that these two Ladies,  Israel  and  England,  were the Darlings of God, the Daughters of
 Heaven, the Wonder of the Earth, and yet the Envie of the World; and then beheld them in the bitternesse of Sorrow, and in their silent sadnesse, despised, disgraced, rejected, depopulated, distracted, and abused; I could not chuse but sometimes bathe my Subject with my Teares, and following the president of the sad Prophet, wish,  that mine eyes were Rivers of Waters, that I might weepe day and night for the slaine of the Daughter of my people:  Indeed,  Israel  was elder in Joy, and  England  younger in Sorrow; the Warres of  Israel  was farther from our apprehension, the Woes of  England  neerer us in relation: And who that sees her sequestred Husband, her disobedient Children, her frowning Brethren, her bowing
 Battlements, her weakened Bulwarkes, her numerous Enemies, and divided Armies, but will say,  The glory of  England  is departed?  But it is not so: for through the Gate of Mercie wee may espie a Doore of Hope; I rather take these Divisions for a Purge, that will purifie; or a Qualme, that will qualifie; or an Antidote, to expell Poyson; and the darke Cloud of  Englands  Warre, to be a short Thunder-clap, to cleare the corrupted Ayre, 
 Madame, these  Contemplations  are sad, yet Divine; as Divine, fit for all times; and as sad, onely fit for these. 
 When I first composed them in Measure, I intended them for my private
 Solace; but through the importunitie of some (whom Nature hath bound me to obey) I have committed them now to publike Censure, which I must expect to be hard enough; yet farre more charitable, if they flye through the world under the shadow of your Honours wings. 
 These (Honourable Lady) are the First-Fruits of my Poetrie (either Morall or Divine) which I humbly offer to your Honour: To commend them, I cannot; and discommend them, I will not: Few will denie the goodnesse of the Subject, though many may carpe at the Object; and these will onely be the Scholars of  Zoylus,  who finde fault with all things, yet can mend nothing. 
 
 Thinke it not presumption (my Honoured Ladie) that I have intruded so farre upon your Goodnesse, in presenting so unworthie an Offering; and let the Error consume in his Zeale, who is no lesse, nor can begge to be any more, then your Honours servant, 
 JEREMIAH RICH.
