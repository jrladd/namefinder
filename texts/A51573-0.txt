 MADAM, 
 T He world hath been dead to me of late; I wish I were as dead to it. It is hard to make or keep a friend in adversity: and innocency is no protection; it rather exposeth unto dangers. But I intend not to write satyres, nor to trouble your Ladyship with any tedious or unacceptable discourse. I rather submit my self and cause to him, who is best able to judge: and amongst other my worthy friends, whose favour hath had influence upon me, I fly unto your self for protection, humbly intreating you to accept of my homage and service, whilst according to my ingagements I do ever remain' 
 Your Ladyships in all hmuble observance, HENRY MAISTERSON.
