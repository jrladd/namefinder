 
 
 To the Right Honourable the EARLE of LINDSEY, Lord great CHAMBERLAIN of ENGLAND. 
 Right Honourable, 
 T HE patronage of Arts being hereditary to your noble Ancestors, especially that of War, wherein so
 
many of the famous  ERTU'S have been transcendently glorious encouraged these few sheets of mine to crave the protection of your Lordships favour against the malicious ignorance of this unhappy age. The addresses, I do humbly acknowledge savour of too much boldnesse: the Treatise short: and the Authour not of yeares Confident to present pieces worthy of your Lordships favour, or perusall. Yet the matter in it selfe being Noble and suitable to these times, and the well known propensity in your
 
Lordships nature, to cherish ingenuous endevours with the particular service I ever did owe and beare to your Lordship and Noble Family, occasioned these bold addresses 
 Of your Lordships my LORD, most humble Servant,  N. NYE.
