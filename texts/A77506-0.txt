 
 
 TO MY
WORTHY FRIENDS,
The well Affected Inhabitants
of the Towne of Great Yarmouth. 
 Much esteemed in the Lord, 
 W Hat you lately received
from the  Pulpit, 
take here from the
 Presse,  that what
was then  Transient 
in the  Eare,  may be now  Permanent 
to the  Eye. Weake bodies  which
are subject to  Heart-tremblings 
and  faintings,  use to have their  Cordials, 
or  Strong-waters  by them.
 
To like purpose serveth this  Extract, 
intended for an  Aqua Coelestis,  for
the fortifying of your Spirits (in these
times of  Common Danger ) against
what ever feares or dangers you may
happily encounter with. If you shall
have neede, make use of it; otherwise
let it remaine by you; I dare assure you,
it will be no ill store. However, I shall
leave it with you, and rest 
 Your servant in our Lord
Iohn Brinsley.
