 
 TO THE HONOVRABLE House of COMMONS Assembled in PARLIAMENT. 
 V Estrum est imperare, nostrum obsequi:  Your Commands wraped up in your Desires I have desired to obey, both to the Pulpit and the Presse. Not that I can tender any thing either to your eares or eyes, which may be worth your acceptance, but that I cannot but most readily tender obedience when you command,
 
and labour to serve you, when you call for my service. The subject of that houres Discourse that I had then before you, and of this Booke, which is the same, was very well worthy your eyes and eares, if the managing of it had but fallen into a skilfull hand; [For what more needfull duty to bee urged or to be practised, then  Heart-communication.]  But according to my poverty I was then ready to offer, and you were pleased to accept; and I hope for the like acceptance now. I humbly recommended the words then spoken to your hearts, and so I doe now the same written: and as I desire to present them now written to your hands, so doe I my selfe, and all I am or can at your feet; as 
 Your poore humble devoted 
Servant,
J. L.
