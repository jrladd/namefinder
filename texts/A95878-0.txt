 
 
 TO THE
RIGHT HONOVRABLE,
THE
Lady Rebeccah Wollaston, Lady Majoresse
of the most famous and renowned City of London,
and to the Right Worshipfull the Ladie Anne Sprignall,
Two most eminent Patronesses and Patterns of Virtue and
Piety: J: Æ². ever prayeth all encrease of Grace here,
and fulnesse of Glorie hereafter. 
 Right Honourable and Right Worshipfull: 
 T He many deepe  tyes  and fast-binding
 Ligaments  of obliged  Gratitude, 
which have long time tied me in all
sincere  observances  to both your
good  Ladyships;  doe extraordinarily
induce, nay enforce me to most  serious study  and  resolution 
to lay happy hold on all  opportunities  (though
but in any small measure, rather than to incur the least
suspect of black  Ingratitude,  hatefull to God and men)
to manifest the  integrity  of my most gratefull  Heart,  in
any, in all my sincere  Services  and best  abilities.  And having
now composed and compiled this little  Treatise, 
entituled,  Babylons Beautie,  or  The Romish-Catholickes
Sweet-heart;  Even a briefe Description of that impudent
 
and audacious  Whore of Rome,  the  Great Diana  of
these back sliding daies. Me thought I could not possibly
pitch upon more fit  Patrons  thereof, than your
good  Ladiships,  my ever worthily most honoured good
 Friends,  whom I know by most happie experience to
be two most eminently gracious and grave  Matrons  in
this our  Israel;  two most fruitfull and faithfull  Professours 
and  practisers  of true  Piety  and  Holines;  yea, I say,
two most hearty and heroick  haters  and  contemners  of
this  Romish-Strumpet,  and all her most detestable  Idolatries 
and abhominable superstitious  fooleries  and mimicall
 fopperies  in Religion, meer  baubles  of  Babel  to mock
and cheat the children of  errour  &  disobedience.  Accept
then ( Right Honourable  and  Right Worshipfull ) I humbly
pray you, this small  Symboll  and true  Testimonie  of my
most  gratefull heart,  and ever, every way, bounden  best
services  (for many most immerited sweet favours) truly
and duly devoted to both your  good Ladyships.  Which
singular  favour  and accustomed Christian  Candour  will
(and that most meritoriously) extraordinarily add unto,
and mightily augment the, already,  deep endeerments 
of 
 Your good Honours and Worships
in his Prayers, his Best,
ever to be commanded,
John Vicars.
