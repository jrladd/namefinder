 Beloved Friends, 
 I T is well knowne unto you, at whose request these Sermons (now presented joyntly to you both) came to bee preached, and for whose sake they are thus
  printed; if any good come to any by either, next unto God, the thankes is due unto you; I cannot denie to doe that service which commeth within the compasse of my calling and power, which may either profit your selves, or satisfie any of your Noble friends; my onely sorrow is, that I have so long delayed my promise, and your expectations; you now see, long look for commeth at length, and my earnest desire is that it may answer the expectation of the Noble Lady, and my thankfull mind, whose requitals
  to you and yours for many undeserved favours, lay in no other way then the furthering of your spirituall good, and comfort. God (you see) gaineth glory to himselfe by weake meanes, and many times derided Sermons by braine-sick, and full men, doe proove relishing and healing to wounded consciences: I wish from my heart unto you both, and all yours the peace and purity of conscience, the integrity and sincerity of holy walking; together with the addition of all graces and comforts belonging
  unto Christians, and that a spurre may be found in these Sermons, to prick you on to a holy care of conscience, which will proove your best friend, or worst enemy; beleeve me (friends) the man is as his conscience is; if that bee good in constitution, and in execution, all things will answer to it in life and death: you enjoying its goodnesse, shall not faile of its strength and boldnesse; make much of it, and cherish it therefore as your best lewell, and in so doing, I shall account my paines plentifully recompenced,
  and be further encouraged to bee yours in what I am able when you shall bee pleased to comÂ¦mand me; in meane time I take leave, and rest 
 Yours in the Lord Iesus, IOHN SEDGVVICK.
